Step 1. Teach your almost-2-year-old to say "Happy New Year".

Step 2. Wake said almost-2-year-old up in the middle of the night because you were going to a New Years party and didn't have babysitting so you had him sleep in the guest room except he woke up and then saw all the cake and sweets and wanted to eat all the cake and then he had a sugar high and wanted to party.

Step 3. Lie awake in bed at 2 am as said almost-2-year-old says "Happy new year!" over and over and over and over.

Happy New Year, everybody!
