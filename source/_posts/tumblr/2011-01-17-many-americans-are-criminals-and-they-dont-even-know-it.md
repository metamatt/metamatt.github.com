> If you don't consider yourself a criminal, do you have anything to hide?
Well, maybe:

> For one thing, many Americans are criminals and they don't even know it. Due
to the disturbing phenomenon known as "[**overcriminalization**](http://www.he
ritage.org/research/reports/2010/08/overcriminalization)," it's very easy to
break the law nowadays without realizing it. A May 2010
[**study**](http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2010/05/Without-Intent)
from the conservative Heritage Foundation and the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers found that three out of every five new nonviolent
criminal offenses don't require criminal intent. The Congressional Research
Service can't even count the number of criminal offenses currently on the
books in the United States, estimating the number to be in the "tens of
thousands."
