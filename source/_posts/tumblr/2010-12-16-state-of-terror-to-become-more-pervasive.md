Now, to make sure people are even more continually conscious that we need to
be terrorized by terrorists, we're going to advertise this in Wal-Mart. Two
different blogs I read linked to this news last week: [John Gruber compared it
to the movie Brazil](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/12/07/walmart-
homeland-security) and [Bruce Schneier compared it to the book
1984](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/12/department_of_h_2.html).

These comparisons remind me of a joke I used to make during the Bush
presidency: people were intended to look at works of dystopia sci-fi like
Brazil and 1984 and see a cautionary tale; the neo-cons looked at these same
works and saw an instruction manual.

Of course, here we are in 2010, Bush and the neo-cons are out of office, and
yet the madness continues.
