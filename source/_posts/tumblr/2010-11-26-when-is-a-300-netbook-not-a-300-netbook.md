title: When is a $300 netbook not a $300 netbook?

Since we were going to be spending so much time on the road this year, Vanessa
and I bought a $300 netbook to bring with us. (Rationale: I didn't want to
bring something heavier or more expensive all over Asia and South America; I
also don't want to type any of my account passwords into any computer I don't
control.)

Well, I found netbooks starting at $300, but at the time I was looking (March
2010) there were newer models available with double the battery life, which
seemed useful for traveling, costing $350â€¦ and that's with Windows 7 Home
Basic edition, and 1GB of memory.

First things first, running Windows 7 in 1GB is an exercise in pain. (Well,
running it on a slow netbook will be anyway, especially once we try to do
photo processing in Lightroom, but so it goes; again we didn't want something
heavier or much more expensive. But the memory we can do something about.) So
we upgraded it to 2GB of memory for $40 -- this part at least we figured out
before we left home.

What I hadn't predicted was how limiting the Home Basic edition of Windows
would be. Two Windows features that are really valuable for travelers sharing
a computer are

- fast user switching, so two people can switch between their own accounts without completely logging out

- internet connection sharing, so if one person is using the computer, the other can [use a spare smartphone like an iPhone over the same network connection](http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2010/11/24/windows-connection-sharing-for-travel-network-access/)

and it turns out these features are only available in the Home Premium edition
of Windows 7. Microsoft lets you upgrade between editions at any time, but
charges $70 for the privilege.

So, the $300 netbook turned into a $450 netbook. It works a lot better now,
though.
