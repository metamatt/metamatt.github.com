We've stayed in 3 places in Argentina that were sufficiently apartment-like to
come with a kitchen or kitchenette with gas stove.

Only one of them included a way to light the stove (and none of the stoves
were self-lighting).

The first time, the kitchen also had an on-demand (tankless) water heater, and
while the pilot flame isn't strong enough to light a candle from, we figured
out we could turn on the hot water, watch the real water heater flame ignite,
stick a candle inside the hot water heater, light the candle, then light the
stove from the candle (then turn off the hot water).

The second time, they kindly gave us matches.

The third time, we had to buy our own lighter. No lucky hot water heater here.
