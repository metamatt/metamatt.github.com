I wanted to use my newÂ [remap-volume-keys
trick](http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/01/10/how-to-make-software-volume-
control-useful-for-mac-with-digital-speaker-output/) to turn the useless
volume slider on the Logitech DiNovo Edge keyboard into a scroll wheel
replacement. (The volume slider is useless to me because, like in the story in
the previous link, I'm using a digital sound output from this computer, and
Mac OS won't adjust the master volume on digital sound outputs. And while the
DiNovo Edge has built-in scrolling support with a gesture on the touchpad, the
touchpad is too small and the gesture is hard to perform and overall, I think
the volume slider would be much more useful for scrolling.)

No luck so far though -- USB Overdrive doesn't see buttons on the DiNovo Edge
at all, probably because it's Bluetooth and not natively USB. And I tried
installing Logitech's own control software, which does allow me to customize
the meaning of certain keys and gestures, but it doesn't allow me to specify
any different behavior for the volume keys.
