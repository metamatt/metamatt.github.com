Apparently apps from the Mac App Store are wrapped in DRM (not surprising) and
this DRM is somehow tied to the motherboard hardware, not the OS install or
the disk drive hardware (more surprising).

I wouldn't have realized this until I "upgraded" my Mac Pro by buying a newer
one, and plopping the SSDs from the old one into the new one. This let me
avoid installing or configuring the OS or apps; everything ran just fine but
faster; everything, that is, except apps from the Mac App Store, which all
(individually) prompted for my MAS credentials with a dialog about how "this
app was purchased on another computer".

(I expect this scenario and dialog are more common when copying the app
bundles from one computer to another; that's an obvious case of purchasing an
app on one computer and running it on another; moving the whole drive and OS
install is less obviously a new computer — hey, it's still got the same
hostname — but it triggers the same scenario.)
