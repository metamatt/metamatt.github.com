I just found a useful answer on [Amazon Askville](http://askville.amazon.com/)
and wanted to vote it up. It says you have to be signed in to vote, so ok,
I'll sign in. It's Amazon, so I should already have an account, right? Not
quite.

On the sign-in page, it says "Amazon Askville is an Amazon company that uses
Amazon for credential verification", and asks for a username and password.
Looks like Amazon username and password would work, right? So I enter those,
and it just says no. Then I click the create account button, and then there's
a link to sign in with Amazon credentials, so I enter the same Amazon username
and password again and that works.

So to summarize: Askville's initial signin page implies it uses Amazon
credentials, but doesn't, but actually does after 2 extra clicks which aren't
particularly intuitive.
