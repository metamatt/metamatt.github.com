MG Siegler, [Apple’s Magic Is In The Turn, Not The
Prestige](http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/13/the-iphone-5-event/):

> So while some may find Apple’s trick old hat now, no one else has figured
out how to pull it off — except for the company doing a mediocre copy of the
trick. I’d argue it’s because everyone is focusing on The Pledge and The
Prestige, but Apple is the only one focusing on The Turn.

Also, I've been meaning to see that movie.
