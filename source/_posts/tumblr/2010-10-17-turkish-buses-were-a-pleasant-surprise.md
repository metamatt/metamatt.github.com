I'm not used to traveling by bus but I've been pleasantly surprised by Turkish
buses.  They're not that fast, but they are cheap, comfortable enough, leave
on time, arrive on time, and go from everywhere to everywhere.  I arrived in
Turkey planning our trip mostly around what's possible by air travel but
definitely shouldn't discount the bus system.

Update: except when the attendants smoke -- not a pleasant surprise.
