All my Apple devices -- iPhone, iPod Nano -- that I'm traveling with think
that Argentina is 2 hours ahead of Eastern time (EDT), when really it should
be only 1 hour ahead right now.  (Argentina doesn't use daylight savings time,
which adds an hour to all US times right now; Argentina is always GMT-3, and
EST would be GMT-5 but during daylight savings time, Eastern time becomes EDT
which is GMT-4.)  How does Apple get this wrong?

(My Windows netbook gets it right automatically; 3 different digital cameras
from Canon, Nikon and Panasonic have a manual daylight savings adjust, so it's
easy to get wrong, but once I learned how to take the extra step, they give me
the opportunity to do it right.  I don't see any daylight savings settings on
the Apple devices, though.)

In practice, I just had to tell the iPod and iPhone that I'm in Santiago.

Update: Even after the US went back to Standard time in early November, the
iPod and iPhone still get it wrong -- now Argentina is 2 hours ahead of EST
but my iPod thinks it's 3 hours ahead. So it's not a daylight savings thing
after all -- it's just wrong.
