If you're entertained by finding patterns in noise, meaning in chaos -- even
false meanings -- and especially if you're a English-speaking rap-listening
Burning Man-attending engineer -- perhaps you'll be as amused by these
acronyms and airport codes as I am.

EZE -- the Buenos Aires international airport, Ezeiza, practically screams
"straight outta Compton".

BRC -- the Bariloche airport, or the Black Rock City airport. (If you do a
Google search for "BRC airport", both pop up in the top 3.)

FTE -- the El Calafate airport or, if you've worked in Silicon Valley and had
to read any resumes or job postings, a full-time engineer.

AC and DC -- the equivalent of BC and AD in English, meaning Ante Cristo and
Desde Cristo. In English, we use AC and DC to refer to different kinds of
electric current, but also the rock band (whose name, judging by their
lightning-bolt logo, was inspired by electricity). But since they also have a
Genisis-inspired song (Let There Be Rock), who knows -- this comes full circle
back to the Spanish Biblical meaning for AC/DC.
