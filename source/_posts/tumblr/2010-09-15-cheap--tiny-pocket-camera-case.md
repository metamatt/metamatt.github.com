Useful tip: for carrying a pocket digital camera, keep it in a $5 microfiber
bag like the ones used for sunglasses (easily obtainable at a sunglass store
if you don't already have one).

It adds nothing to the size, so the pocket camera still fits in your pocket.
It protects the screen, and keeps the camera reasonably free of dust. It
doesn't protect it against drops, so don't drop your camera -- sure, you could
get a padded case but then it's no longer a pocket camera.

I've kept my last 3 pocket-sized cameras in nothing more protective, while
they lived years in my pocket accompanying me on various adventures, and
they're all faring fine, except for one which I landed on in a skiing crash.
Oh well.
