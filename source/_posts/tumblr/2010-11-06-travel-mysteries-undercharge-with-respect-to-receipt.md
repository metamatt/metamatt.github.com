We've noticed that a few tour bus companies in Ushuaia, running between the
town and the national park, will offer us a discount (say 55 pesos round trip
for what they say is normally 70 pesos), but then write the original full
price (70 pesos) on the receipt and ticket. Why would they do that?

I'm familiar with various schemes where someone charges you a high price and
then documents a lower price (maybe they pay tax on the documented price,
maybe you pay duty or tax on the documented price, maybe they're working on a
basis where they have to give X% of the documented price to whoever owns the
taxi or bus or stand or what have you -- in any of these cases, it's to their
advantage to hide some of the money they're making). What's happening here is
the opposite, and I'm curious what the angle is.

Maybe they're not officially allowed to compete on price -- there's a set
price for all bus companies, and nobody's supposed to undercut it to attract
customers -- but they do anyway, and don't want written record of that?
