[Kellan Elliott-McCrea on data portability at
Flickr](http://laughingmeme.org/2010/05/18/minimal-competence-data-access-
data-ownership-and-sharecropping/)

"With Flickr you can get out, via the API, every single piece of information
you put into the system."

I think this makes a pretty good definition of the minimum standard for data
portability that online services should be held to -- to paraphrase, anything
you put in you can get back out.
