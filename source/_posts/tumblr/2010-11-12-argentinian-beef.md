Apparently by visiting now we're slipping in just under the window for the
legendary Argentinian beef… people are complaining already it's gone down in
quality and up in price just in the last year, but they expect it to keep
getting worse. The reason is a combination of the American feedlot system
taking over, and bad government subsidy policy which means there's no money in
beef and too much money in soy… Argentina is now actually a net *importer* of
beef now (mostly from Uruguay). And the people I talked to were not happy
about that.
