For the time being, I have a residential cable connection from Comcast as my
connection to the Internet. One of the things that Comcast gets a lot of
criticism for is their [250GB monthly transfer
limit](http://customer.comcast.com/Pages/FAQViewer.aspx?seoid=frequently-
asked-questions-about-excessive-use), aka "cap".

(As an aside, the cap is pretty silly, especially because it's the same for
all the different speeds Comcast sells. That means if you pay more for a
faster connection, you can hit the cap even faster. For their cheaper
"Performance" plan, at 15mbps, you can transfer 250GB in about 46 hours, or
less than 3 days. For their fastest "Ultra" plan, at 50mbps, you can hit the
cap in under 14 hours.)

However, one silver lining -- they don't appear to apply the cap to transfers
inside Comcast's network. I use [CrashPlan](http://b3.crashplan.com/) for
backup, swapping storage with a friend in another city who also gets his
Internet connection from Comcast. (CrashPlan is pretty neat -- free automatic
backup to any combination of your own computers or computers your friends
offer to share storage on, or, for a price, CrashPlan the company will store
your backups for you.) In January I managed to backup over 300GB across the
Internet to his house, and checking in Comcast's usage meter, it says I've
only used about 100GB from my 250GB cap.
