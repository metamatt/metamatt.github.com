When using Citibank's site to set a credit card bill to pay itself, I was
forced to make the following declaration:

> "By checking this box, I confirm that my browser is equipped with at least
128-bit security encryption, and my computer is capable of printing or storing
a copy of my AutoPay Enrollment Confirmation."

  
This got me thinking.

How's that going to work for the new, increasingly popular breed of devices
that abstract away or eliminate local storage (most smartphones including
iPhones, tablets including iPads, iOS in general, and maybe ChromeOS)?

I mean, it's not like you really need to store this confirmation, and for the
other similar things that are undergoing a transition from paper to electronic
storage (like the statements themselves) you could always download them as PDF
and then re-upload them to somewhere made for actually storing documents like
DropBox.

Still, there's a disconnect here as everyone tries to move away from paper and
storage at once.
