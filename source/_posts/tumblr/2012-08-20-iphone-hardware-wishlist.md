It’s almost September, [so time for a new iPhone](http://www.imore.com/apple-
iphone-5-and-ipad-mini-event-planned-september-12-iphone-5-release-date-
september-21).

What’s coming this fall from the software side ([iOS
6](http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/)) is mostly public already.

What’s coming this fall from the hardware side is just rumor, but seems to
revolve around [a larger 16:9
screen](http://daringfireball.net/2012/05/bigger_display_iphone_thing_wwdc),
[a unibody enclosure](http://thetechblock.com/the-unibody-iphone), and [a
smaller replacement for the dock
connector](http://itsmorereal.tumblr.com/post/29480903669/the-foolproof-dock-
connector).

Here, with no connection to reality, the above rumors, or any inside
information, is what I _wish_ Apple would add on the hardware side:

  * Wireless charging (a la [Palm Touchstone](http://www.hpwebos.com/us/products/accessories/touchstone-technology.html), or, like, every electric toothbrush ever). Since iOS 5 added over-the-air upgrades and wireless cloud backup and iTunes sync, pretty much the only reason I need to plug my iPhone into a cable is to charge it. Even better than a smaller “foolproof” dock connector is no connector.
  * USB 3. Probably a no-brainer, but now that the iPhone shoots HD video, it accumulates some pretty darn big files. After charging, the only other reason I plug my phone into a cable is to transfer photos and videos; sure, this could be done over Wi-Fi, but for gigabyte video files, neither USB 2 nor Wi-Fi is satisfyingly fast. USB 3 should be.
  * NFC. [Google is turning Android phones into wallets](http://www.google.com/wallet/); [Apple is adding this new Passbook feature in iOS 6](http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#passbook); it would work better with NFC. But even more than replacing my wallet, [I’d like my phone to replace my keychain](https://twitter.com/metamatt/status/237615159928057856), and NFC would help with that too.
  * Water resistance. How many iPhones (or other phones, music players, cameras, or other devices that could be replaced by iPhones) have you seen destroyed by water? Me, a lot. I’m not a hardware engineer, but there aren’t all that many openings on an iPhone (especially if they’re about to redesign the biggest one anyway); the battery is sealed inside; I wonder how hard it would be to make iPhones survive at least casual contact with water. (Apple’s gone to the trouble of [adding a special moisture sensor to detect liquid damage and rule it out of warranty coverage](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3302); wouldn’t it be nice if neither they nor their customers had to worry about it?)
