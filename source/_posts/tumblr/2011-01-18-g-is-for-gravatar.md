When creating my [gravatar account](http://en.gravatar.com/metamatt), I was
asked to choose a rating.

This surprised me for two reasons -- first, gravatars have ratings? I don't
think I really want to see any X or even R rated gravatars. (And sure,
preventing people from seeing what they didn't want to see is the whole
purpose of having a rating in the first place, except until they fed me this
page, it hadn't previously occurred to me that I or anyone else could should
or would use gravatars for, er, X rated purposes.) Second, I thought that [the
ratings below X were trademarked by the MPAA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mot
ion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system), no?
