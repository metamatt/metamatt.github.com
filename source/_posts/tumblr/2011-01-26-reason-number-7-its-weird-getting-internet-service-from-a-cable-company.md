Ads for a Holyfield match during a tech support call?

Reason #7 that it's sub-ideal getting your Internet service from your cable
company, i.e. a company whose real profit motive is to sell you every possible
communications service but mostly incoming video at old-school prices: you
have to listen to ads for pay-per-view boxing matches when you're on hold for
customer support.
