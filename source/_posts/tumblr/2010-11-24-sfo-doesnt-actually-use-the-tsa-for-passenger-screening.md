[SFO doesnt actually use the TSA for passenger
screening?](http://blog.tsa.gov/2010/11/airports-who-opt-out-of-tsa-
screening.html)

[This TSA blog post](http://blog.tsa.gov/2010/11/airports-who-opt-out-of-tsa-
screening.html) is mostly a reaction to the story about how airports can opt
out of hiring the TSA for passenger screening, reminding people that even if
an airport does this it's still regulated by the TSA -- they still have to
follow the same procedures the TSA would.

However, it also comes with a list of airports where security isn't run by the
TSA. Of personal interest, it includes SFO. I guess I'd noticed different
uniforms on the security personnel but it hadn't registered that they weren't
actually TSA.
