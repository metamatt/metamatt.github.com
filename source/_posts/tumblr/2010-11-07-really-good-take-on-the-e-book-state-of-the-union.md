[Really good take on the e-book state of the
union](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/reviews/2010/11/kindle-3-e-book-readers-
go-mainstream.ars)

Nate Anderson has a really good description of the current state of the e-book
world, as shown by the Kindle 3 -- the device, and also the issues surrounding
whether to buy/borrow/read books on paper vs electronically.

He points out one subtle issue which I think is really important for the
adoption of e-books. Consider downloadable music, which really took off with
the introduction of the iPod and its "rip, mix, burn" mentality, showing that
you could bootstrap your new pure-electronic library by converting your
existing music library, and then go on buying music in either the old physical
format (CD) or new downloadable format. With e-books, you have to choose one,
and the choices bifurcate; as Anderson writes "it appears that all but the
youngest of us are doomed to go through life with two different codexes,
physical and electronic."

I know this matters for me -- I like reading on Kindle, but often miss having
access to a book I already have on paper somewhere.
