I've signed up to run the New York City marathon in November. It'll be my
first marathon, so both training and the actual event should be interesting
and challenging.

In addition to the personal challenge, I'm running on a team collecting
donations for the [Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation](http://themmrf.org/).
(Before anyone freaks out, no, I don't have any direct connection to this
disease, neither I nor any of my immediate relatives or acquaintances. I chose
to fundraise for them because my mom and her oncologist husband say they do
good research and use their money wisely. And as my mom said, "The fight
against any kind of cancer benefits the fight against all kinds of cancer.")

If you can spare $20, or more, or less, to sponsor me and support the MMRF, I,
the MMRF, and multiple myeloma patients present and future would all
appreciate it: [just follow this link to my fundraising
page](http://www.active.com/donate/2011mmrfNYC/NYFULLMGinzton). Thank you.
