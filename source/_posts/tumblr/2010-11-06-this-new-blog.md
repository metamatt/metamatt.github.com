After repeatedly saying someday I'll start a blog and then not doing it
because of all the stuff it's already missing and all the stuff I won't have
time to post later, I'm just jumping in in the middle. First up I'll be
posting a bunch of stuff from our (my and Vanessa's) current travels, both
going forward in time and catching up from a while back, so there'll be stuff
popping up here in an ad hoc manner, some of it backdated, and hopefully
without causing too much confusion.
