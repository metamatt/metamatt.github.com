[iOS 4 on iPhone 3G -- lawsuit
material?](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/11/lawsuit-apple-turned-
iphone-3gs-into-ibricks-to-boost-iphone-4.ars)

On the one hand, it's silly to use class action lawsuits as the tool to
address software bugs, but on the other hand, if Apple's going to publish an
update this bad and then actively prevent people from just going back to the
other version, what other recourse do upset customers have?

Having seen the issue firsthand -- how horribly sluggish an iPhone 3G became
after upgrading from iOS 3.1 to 4.0 -- I can see how people would get really
frustrated. I'm sure Apple just saw this is a bug to fix in the next update
(iOS 4.1 is said to fix it, though I haven't tried it yet), but for people
whose daily-use phone was horribly sluggish for a couple months while they
waited for that upgrade, it's hard to excuse Apple for not letting them
downgrade back to 3.1 in the meantime.
