Here's what I really want from the mobile phone market: I want to be able to

1. Buy my choice of phone at a fair market price (not one distorted by
subsidies)

2. Use that phone on whichever network I want

3. Pay for the network service I actually use, at a fair market rate (not
restricted by available fixed-usage plans)

Right now, especially in the U.S., none of this is true. Phone purchases are
heavily subsidized by mandatory service contracts, hiding the actual cost of
the phone and allowing the unsubsidized price to be absurdly high. Phones are
generally sold locked for a specific network, preventing you from using it
with other networks -- even after you've paid off the subsidy, if any. And in
the US, in addition to this artificial economic barrier, we've managed to
build separate networks using different incompatible technology (Sprint and
Verizon run CDMA networks; AT&T and T-Mobile run GSM networks). Finally, the
networks rope you into paying a fixed monthly cost regardless of how much or
little you use their service, by pricing ala carte service (for voice and SMS,
but especially for data) ridiculously high.

So the status quo, especially in the U.S., is that you have to pick your phone
from what's available for your choice of network (or vice versa); then you get
a shiny fancy new phone for a deceptively low price (but woe to you if you
break it or lose it or have it stolen or want to upgrade on your own
schedule); then you pay back that deceptively low price in your monthly fees
for the next couple years (and woe to you if your usage patterns don't map
closely to one of the available "plans").

I'm not holding my breath, but the above 3 freedoms are what I wish for.
