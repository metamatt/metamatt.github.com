title: A waterproof tablet! A step in in the right direction

In [this announcement of a new Sony tablet for
Android](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/02/sony-unveils-thinnest-10-1
-tablet-ever-the-xperia-tablet-z/), the following bit stood out to me:

> The company claims the tablet is not only the “world’s thinnest 10.1-inch
tablet” at 6.9 millimeters, but it's apparently waterproof in up to three feet
of water for 30 minutes.

The water resistance is a lot more notable to me than the thinness, in an
industry obsessed with thin fragile things, given how many phones I've seen
destroyed by water, and given how [I put this on my wishlist for the iPhone
5](http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2012/08/20/iphone-hardware-wishlist/) last
fall. But phones see a lot more exposure to dangerous circumstances than
tablets do, I wager, so I'd still like to see this feature make its way over
to phones.
