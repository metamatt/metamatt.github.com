Here are the stats on my cellular data usage over one year on Sprint's
network[^1]. (I got the phone on Halloween of 2011, and took this screenshot on
Halloween of 2012.)

7 GB down and 1 GB up; 8 GB total; that averages to 666 MB per month. Clearly
I'm not a heavy cellular data user and not making the most out of Sprint's
unlimited data allotment; this would fit comfortably within the other
carriers' smallest real[^2] data plans (1GB/month).

Speaking of unlimited data plans: this might sound heretical to some, but I
really wouldn't mind metered data at a fair price. Say a penny a megabyte,
billing you only for what you use. That comes out to $10 per gigabyte, which
is actually the marginal rate that AT&T and Verizon are charging now anyway,
except first they make you pay a minimum $30/month commitment and then they
round up to the next gigabyte.

Of course, I also wouldn't mind an unlimited plan that was cheap and fast and
allowed tethering[^3].

In the meantime, here in the US we have Sprint offering unlimited data at a
price that's fair for heavy users but not especially cheap for light users,
and their network isn't the fastest and they have surcharge for tethering.
Then we have AT&T and Verizon saying unlimited plans don't incent them to
invest in their networks so they've moved to metered plans; on the plus side
their networks have gotten markedly faster and they don't charge extra for
tethering on the metered plans; however their metering methods don't meet my
definition of fair.

[^1]: Actually 11 1/2 months on Sprint's network, and 10 days on O2 Ireland and 3 days on Three UK during a trip to Europe. Both of their data networks, but especially Three's, were better than what I'm accustomed to in the USA, which is especially infuriating given they're also much cheaper.

[^2]: Ignoring AT&T's toy 250 MB/month plan.

[^3]: Which actually exists in much of the world, but not in the USA.
