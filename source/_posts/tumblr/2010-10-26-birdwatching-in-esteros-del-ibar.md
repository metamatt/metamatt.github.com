Disclaimer: I'm no expert birdwatcher and have heretofore exhibited little
interest in birding. However, staying for a couple days at the edge of Esteros
del Ibará, a provincial park and wildlife sanctuary in northern Argentina,
there were so many birds, and our hosts so eager about pointing them out,
there was nothing for it but to go along and get excited about birds.

listed in Aves de Argentina y Uruguay, or Birds of Argentina & Uruguay, gold
edition).
