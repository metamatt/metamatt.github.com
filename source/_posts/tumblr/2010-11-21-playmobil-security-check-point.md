[Playmobil Security Check
Point](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002CYTL2)

The reviews for this are hilarious; people are using Amazon's review system
for social commentary (to the exclusion of any literal reviews of the product
itself). It's a little hard to tell whether it's even a real product.

My guess is the product is real, and the reviews are not in the spirit of real
reviews; while I've got no problem with this form of social commentary I
wonder if it's the kind of thing Amazon would take down once the wrong people
notice. For better or worse, the actual toy is no longer available for sale.
Too bad; after reading the reviews I sort of want one!
