For my home ISP I switched from DSL to cable some time back. My DSL provider
(Speakeasy) had more friendly policies but their speeds just weren't keeping
up with what the cable ISPs offer.

However, [their speed test site](http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/) remains
my go-to speed tester even when using other ISPs, and is perfectly willing to
benchmark connections faster than anything Speakeasy offers.

Here's a recent result of the speed test from my home connection. Every time
I've run this, I've found it amusing that it ends with an ad for one of their
services they think might appeal to you, even though in my case it would be 3x
the price for 1/4th the speed (charitably using the upload speed for
comparison; the ratio for download speed would be even less favorable).
