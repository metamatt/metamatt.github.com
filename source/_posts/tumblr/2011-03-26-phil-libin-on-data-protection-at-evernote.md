[Phil Libin on data protection at
Evernote](http://blog.evernote.com/2011/03/24/evernote%E2%80%99s-three-laws-

[Evernote's Three Laws of Data
Protection](http://blog.evernote.com/2011/03/24/evernote%E2%80%99s-three-laws-
of-data-protection/):

> Everything we do at Evernote follows these three basic rules:

>

>   1. Your Data is _Yours_

>   2. Your Data is _Protected_

>   3. Your Data is _Portable_

Like what I said about [Flickr's similar
pronouncement](http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2010/05/19/kellan-elliott-mccrea-
on-data-portability-at-flickr/), this is totally the right approach for
companies that want to be trusted with your data. I almost hesitate to heap
praise on these companies for just doing what's right, since (as I said
before) this is basically the minimum standard that should be acceptable and
it should be the norm, but it's not really the norm, and Evernote and Flickr
are two companies that treat their users and their data better than the norm,
so, sure, let's continue to praise them.
