<div class="entry-content"><p>When I moved between houses in 2008, since I was moving anyway it seemed like
a good time to re-evaluate my options for Internet providers.</p>

<p>In this neighborhood of San Francisco, I actually have a lot more choices than
are available in most of the USA: 2 cable providers (Comcast &amp; Astound),
first-party DSL from AT&amp;T, or 3rd-party DSL over AT&amp;T&#8217;s wires.</p>

<p>I wanted speeds faster than DSL (the only affordable DSL connections topped
out at 6mbps/768kbps), so I decided to try cable. The 2 cable providers
offered similar speeds at the time, and I&#8217;d heard bad things about Comcast, so
I signed up with Astound.</p>

<p>Unlike telephone wires (one company has a local monopoly and owns all the
wires, but is required to share the wires for rental by other companies, hence
the existence of 3rd-party DSL), cable companies don&#8217;t have to share their
wires, that I&#8217;m aware of. That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s no 3rd party cable internet, and
most areas don&#8217;t have multiple cable providers. But this area does. So, there
are 3 different sets of wires running along the poles along my street (4 if
you count AC power): Comcast coax carrying Comcast signals, Astound coax
carrying Astound signals, and AT&amp;T twisted pairs carrying who-knows-who&#8217;s
signals. There was already a Comcast wire running to my building, but not an
Astound wire, so when I first signed up, they had to run a new wire.</p>

<p>They did it wrong. I didn&#8217;t realize at first, but over the first 2 weeks, my
Internet connection would be reliable and plenty of fast most of the time, and
then every couple days would break entirely for half an hour or so. I called
Astound a couple times and they tried various troubleshooting purely from
their dispatch center and couldn&#8217;t find any problems; eventually they sent a
tech guy to my house, but he decided the problem was with the wiring which he
couldn&#8217;t reach. It turns out that Astound, as the newest company on the pole,
is also high man on the pole, as in their wires are mounted higher than the
others; also, they use a combination of their own employees and independent
contractors as service techs, and the guy they&#8217;d sent this time was a
contractor. His ladder wouldn&#8217;t reach as high as the Astound cable, so he had
to call a real Astound guy with a cherry-picker truck. Finally the real
Astound guy showed up, replaced the cable from my house to the main line on
the poles, and showed me that the original cable had a big gash in it, and
basically as it moved in the wind could make or entirely break the electrical
connection. And yet, with a physical connection so tenuous, it worked fine
most of the time.</p>

<p>After that, I didn&#8217;t have any more speed or reliability problems for the next
year.</p>

<p>Pros: pretty fast (18mbps/2mbps down/up); pretty cheap (especially at the 1st-
year introductory rate); worked fine after the first problem was resolved;
tech support was easy to reach and pretty easy to deal with.</p>

<p>Cons: shoddily run. Example 1: the original broken wire they gave me, and the
service tech they sent who couldn&#8217;t reach the wire. Example 2: they forgot to
bill me for 3 months, then noticed and reacted by just turning off my account,
which got my attention to call them pretty quickly &#8211; but it&#8217;s not like I was
failing to pay their bills; they were failing to bill me. Example 3: they had
bogus reverse-DNS entries, so that my IP address would reverse-resolve to a
hostname that forward-resolved to some other IP address, which made it hard to
log into various remote servers by ssh as sshd looks askance at such
tomfoolery.</p>

<p>Anyway, I stuck with this connection for a little more than a year, until
Comcast rolled out DOCSIS 3 in this area, opening the door to faster speeds.
Faster uploads, especially.</p>

<p>One note is that I never saw the purported disadvantage of cable, where the
medium and associated bandwidth is shared among a whole neighborhood, and the
rated speed is high but actual speed decreases when your neighbors are doing
anything &#8211; I got the rated speed pretty much all the time.</p>
