  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ads for a Holyfield match during a tech support call?</p>

<p>Reason #7 that it&rsquo;s sub-ideal getting your Internet service from your cable
company, i.e. a company whose real profit motive is to sell you every possible
communications service but mostly incoming video at old-school prices: you
have to listen to ads for pay-per-view boxing matches when you&rsquo;re on hold for
customer support.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When using Citibank&rsquo;s site to set a credit card bill to pay itself, I was
forced to make the following declaration:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By checking this box, I confirm that my browser is equipped with at least
128-bit security encryption, and my computer is capable of printing or storing
a copy of my AutoPay Enrollment Confirmation.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>This got me thinking.</p>

<p><a href="http://ww%0Aw.flickr.com/photos/metamatt/5388021994/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5215/5388021994_57365e7071.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>How&rsquo;s that going to work for the new, increasingly popular breed of devices
that abstract away or eliminate local storage (most smartphones including
iPhones, tablets including iPads, iOS in general, and maybe ChromeOS)?</p>

<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s not like you really need to store this confirmation, and for the
other similar things that are undergoing a transition from paper to electronic
storage (like the statements themselves) you could always download them as PDF
and then re-upload them to somewhere made for actually storing documents like
DropBox.</p>

<p>Still, there&rsquo;s a disconnect here as everyone tries to move away from paper and
storage at once.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wanted to use my new <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/01/10/how-to-make-software-volume-%0Acontrol-useful-for-mac-with-digital-speaker-output/">remap-volume-keys
trick</a> to turn the useless
volume slider on the Logitech DiNovo Edge keyboard into a scroll wheel
replacement. (The volume slider is useless to me because, like in the story in
the previous link, I&rsquo;m using a digital sound output from this computer, and
Mac OS won&rsquo;t adjust the master volume on digital sound outputs. And while the
DiNovo Edge has built-in scrolling support with a gesture on the touchpad, the
touchpad is too small and the gesture is hard to perform and overall, I think
the volume slider would be much more useful for scrolling.)</p>

<p>No luck so far though &mdash; USB Overdrive doesn&rsquo;t see buttons on the DiNovo Edge
at all, probably because it&rsquo;s Bluetooth and not natively USB. And I tried
installing Logitech&rsquo;s own control software, which does allow me to customize
the meaning of certain keys and gestures, but it doesn&rsquo;t allow me to specify
any different behavior for the volume keys.</p>

<p>For my home ISP I switched from DSL to cable some time back. My DSL provider
(Speakeasy) had more friendly policies but their speeds just weren&rsquo;t keeping
up with what the cable ISPs offer.</p>

<p>However, <a href="http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/">their speed test site</a> remains
my go-to speed tester even when using other ISPs, and is perfectly willing to
benchmark connections faster than anything Speakeasy offers.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a recent result of the speed test from my home connection. Every time
I&rsquo;ve run this, I&rsquo;ve found it amusing that it ends with an ad for one of their
services they think might appeal to you, even though in my case it would be 3x
the price for &frac14;th the speed (charitably using the upload speed for
comparison; the ratio for download speed would be even less favorable).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://labs.vmware.com/flings/mkstaskbarplugin">MKSTaskbarPlugin for VMware Workstation for
Windows</a></p>

<p>I wrote this a few years ago and published it a few months ago &mdash; maybe
someone will find it useful.</p>

<p>mksTaskbarPlugin is a DLL which loads both in the vmware-vmx.exe process (to
get the screen image from the virtual machine) and the explorer.exe process
(to interact with the Windows taskbar).</p>

<p>The result is that you can use extra space on your Windows taskbar to show <a href="http://labs.vmware.com/flings/mkstaskbarplugin">a
scaled-down, live-updating thumbnail image of your choice of VMware virtual
machine</a> running on the same
host. This is useful for keeping an eye on long-running background operations
like software installs in one VM while freeing up most of your screen to
interact with other VMs or the host OS.</p>

<p>When creating my <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/metamatt">gravatar account</a>, I was
asked to choose a rating.</p>

<p>This surprised me for two reasons &mdash; first, gravatars have ratings? I don&rsquo;t
think I really want to see any X or even R rated gravatars. (And sure,
preventing people from seeing what they didn&rsquo;t want to see is the whole
purpose of having a rating in the first place, except until they fed me this
page, it hadn&rsquo;t previously occurred to me that I or anyone else could should
or would use gravatars for, er, X rated purposes.) Second, I thought that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mot%0Aion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system">the
ratings below X were trademarked by the MPAA</a>, no?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>If you don&rsquo;t consider yourself a criminal, do you have anything to hide?
Well, maybe:</p>

<p>For one thing, many Americans are criminals and they don&rsquo;t even know it. Due
to the disturbing phenomenon known as &ldquo;<a href="http://www.he%0Aritage.org/research/reports/2010/08/overcriminalization"><strong>overcriminalization</strong></a>,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s very easy to
break the law nowadays without realizing it. A May 2010
<a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2010/05/Without-Intent"><strong>study</strong></a>
from the conservative Heritage Foundation and the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers found that three out of every five new nonviolent
criminal offenses don&rsquo;t require criminal intent. The Congressional Research
Service can&rsquo;t even count the number of criminal offenses currently on the
books in the United States, estimating the number to be in the &ldquo;tens of
thousands.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought a pair of Beringer MS40 speakers for my Mac and connected them via an
optical digital cable, and immediately the master volume control on the Mac
became useless &mdash; as in disabled. (The speakers have their own volume control,
a physical knob on the left speaker itself, which is slightly out of arm&rsquo;s
reach.)</p>

<p>For convenience, though, I miss having the software volume control, which I
could change from the menubar, my keyboard, and a variety of other places.
Sure, you get the best sound quality by using just one volume control (in this
case, the one on the speakers) and leaving the rest set to maximum, but I
don&rsquo;t need that enforced so strictly; it&rsquo;s useful having a systemwide volume
setting under software control, and the resulting quality impact isn&rsquo;t
immediately horrible. (It&rsquo;s not like the analog out has a fixed level just
below clipping &mdash; it has a variable level! And Windows lets you vary the level
of a digital output.)</p>

<p>A corollary to this is that the volume +/&ndash;/mute buttons on my keyboard (a
standard USB keyboard, not from Apple) no longer do anything useful (they
bring up the normal Mac OS change-volume overlay, except further overlaid with
the international sign of the You Can&rsquo;t Do That Here).</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s how it is and I can&rsquo;t change it. But individual apps that play
music, e.g. iTunes, do have their own software volume control. (With the same
impact on sound quality that Apple&rsquo;s trying to prevent me from inflicting on
myself systemwide! But hey.) So if I can convince Mac OS to interpret the
volume +/&ndash;/mute buttons as normal keys, not mapped directly to the now-useless
master volume setting, but instead let me remap them as systemwide shortcuts
for the iTunes volume setting, then I&rsquo;d get back convenient keyboard control
over music volume.</p>

<p>Can this be done? The Keyboard prefpane in System Preferences lets me add
systemwide shortcuts to an individual app&rsquo;s menu commands, like iTunes&#8217;
&ldquo;Increase Volume&rdquo; command, from any key combination it considers legal for
such a shortcut, but it doesn&rsquo;t notice me pressing the volume buttons,
presumably because the part of the system that maps them to the master volume
is intercepting them too early. (Can that be turned off?)</p>

<p>Update: <a href="http://www.usboverdrive.com/USBOverdrive/News.html">USB Overdrive</a>
solves this. It&rsquo;s got builtin support for recognizing every special key on my
keyboard, and for changing iTunes volume; even if it didn&rsquo;t, it would let me
set weirdo keys to either perform some action from an extensive and
customizable builtin list, or remapped to send some other key combination
which could then be used in the system Keyboard prefpane.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve updated my <a href="http://www.maddogsw.com/evernote-utilities/evernote-palm-importer/">utility for importing notes from Palm Desktop into
Evernote</a>
to take advantage of feedback and fix the most-reported bugs:</p>

<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s now an option to specify character encoding, and a reasonable default if you don&rsquo;t know</li>
<li>Dates (which only exist notes exported from the Mac OS version of Palm Desktop) can be recognized in languages other than English now. (I&rsquo;ve only tested French, since that&rsquo;s the only language people complained about, but if it doesn&rsquo;t work for others, I&rsquo;m sure somebody will let me know and supply sample data.)</li>
<li>If the importer chokes while processing a note (less likely with the above two fixes, but still possible) it continues with the rest of the notes instead of immediately giving up entirely.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.travelpod.com/travel-%0Ablog/metamatt/1/tpod.html">Sabbatical travel map</a></p>

<p>I wanted a visual display of everywhere we went on our sabbatical — ideally a
world map marked up with arrows indicating our route.</p>

<p>Looking for such a thing; the best thing I found was travelpod&rsquo;s map display,
which is a lot heavier than just a map (I didn&rsquo;t really want to create a
separate trip blog) but does the trick. (Google Maps and the other map sites I
tried are great at showing routes for connected road trips, but not flights.)</p>

<p><a href="http:/%0A/www.flickr.com/photos/metamatt/5336648336/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5210/5336648336_b605964578.jpg" alt="map" /></a></p>

<p>So: <a href="http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog/metamatt/1/tpod.html">this is the result, a map indicating our flights and
destinations</a>; I
added a few bread crumbs with links to photos from each country we visited,
but didn&rsquo;t flesh this out with tons of words and photos embedded there like
travelpod wanted me to.</p>

<p>As an aside, if you&rsquo;re into this sort of thing, Apple&rsquo;s iMovie has a pretty
cool travel visualization feature whereby it can automatically show a line
zooming from point A to point B on the globe, to connote travel as a
transition between frames of a movie or slideshow.</p>
