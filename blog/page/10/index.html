  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://labs.vmware.com/flings/mkstaskbarplugin">MKSTaskbarPlugin for VMware Workstation for
Windows</a></p>

<p>I wrote this a few years ago and published it a few months ago &mdash; maybe
someone will find it useful.</p>

<p>mksTaskbarPlugin is a DLL which loads both in the vmware-vmx.exe process (to
get the screen image from the virtual machine) and the explorer.exe process
(to interact with the Windows taskbar).</p>

<p>The result is that you can use extra space on your Windows taskbar to show <a href="http://labs.vmware.com/flings/mkstaskbarplugin">a
scaled-down, live-updating thumbnail image of your choice of VMware virtual
machine</a> running on the same
host. This is useful for keeping an eye on long-running background operations
like software installs in one VM while freeing up most of your screen to
interact with other VMs or the host OS.</p>

<p>When creating my <a href="http://en.gravatar.com/metamatt">gravatar account</a>, I was
asked to choose a rating.</p>

<p>This surprised me for two reasons &mdash; first, gravatars have ratings? I don&rsquo;t
think I really want to see any X or even R rated gravatars. (And sure,
preventing people from seeing what they didn&rsquo;t want to see is the whole
purpose of having a rating in the first place, except until they fed me this
page, it hadn&rsquo;t previously occurred to me that I or anyone else could should
or would use gravatars for, er, X rated purposes.) Second, I thought that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mot%0Aion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system">the
ratings below X were trademarked by the MPAA</a>, no?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>If you don&rsquo;t consider yourself a criminal, do you have anything to hide?
Well, maybe:</p>

<p>For one thing, many Americans are criminals and they don&rsquo;t even know it. Due
to the disturbing phenomenon known as &ldquo;<a href="http://www.he%0Aritage.org/research/reports/2010/08/overcriminalization"><strong>overcriminalization</strong></a>,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s very easy to
break the law nowadays without realizing it. A May 2010
<a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2010/05/Without-Intent"><strong>study</strong></a>
from the conservative Heritage Foundation and the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers found that three out of every five new nonviolent
criminal offenses don&rsquo;t require criminal intent. The Congressional Research
Service can&rsquo;t even count the number of criminal offenses currently on the
books in the United States, estimating the number to be in the &ldquo;tens of
thousands.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought a pair of Beringer MS40 speakers for my Mac and connected them via an
optical digital cable, and immediately the master volume control on the Mac
became useless &mdash; as in disabled. (The speakers have their own volume control,
a physical knob on the left speaker itself, which is slightly out of arm&rsquo;s
reach.)</p>

<p>For convenience, though, I miss having the software volume control, which I
could change from the menubar, my keyboard, and a variety of other places.
Sure, you get the best sound quality by using just one volume control (in this
case, the one on the speakers) and leaving the rest set to maximum, but I
don&rsquo;t need that enforced so strictly; it&rsquo;s useful having a systemwide volume
setting under software control, and the resulting quality impact isn&rsquo;t
immediately horrible. (It&rsquo;s not like the analog out has a fixed level just
below clipping &mdash; it has a variable level! And Windows lets you vary the level
of a digital output.)</p>

<p>A corollary to this is that the volume +/&ndash;/mute buttons on my keyboard (a
standard USB keyboard, not from Apple) no longer do anything useful (they
bring up the normal Mac OS change-volume overlay, except further overlaid with
the international sign of the You Can&rsquo;t Do That Here).</p>

<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s how it is and I can&rsquo;t change it. But individual apps that play
music, e.g. iTunes, do have their own software volume control. (With the same
impact on sound quality that Apple&rsquo;s trying to prevent me from inflicting on
myself systemwide! But hey.) So if I can convince Mac OS to interpret the
volume +/&ndash;/mute buttons as normal keys, not mapped directly to the now-useless
master volume setting, but instead let me remap them as systemwide shortcuts
for the iTunes volume setting, then I&rsquo;d get back convenient keyboard control
over music volume.</p>

<p>Can this be done? The Keyboard prefpane in System Preferences lets me add
systemwide shortcuts to an individual app&rsquo;s menu commands, like iTunes&#8217;
&ldquo;Increase Volume&rdquo; command, from any key combination it considers legal for
such a shortcut, but it doesn&rsquo;t notice me pressing the volume buttons,
presumably because the part of the system that maps them to the master volume
is intercepting them too early. (Can that be turned off?)</p>

<p>Update: <a href="http://www.usboverdrive.com/USBOverdrive/News.html">USB Overdrive</a>
solves this. It&rsquo;s got builtin support for recognizing every special key on my
keyboard, and for changing iTunes volume; even if it didn&rsquo;t, it would let me
set weirdo keys to either perform some action from an extensive and
customizable builtin list, or remapped to send some other key combination
which could then be used in the system Keyboard prefpane.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve updated my <a href="http://www.maddogsw.com/evernote-utilities/evernote-palm-importer/">utility for importing notes from Palm Desktop into
Evernote</a>
to take advantage of feedback and fix the most-reported bugs:</p>

<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s now an option to specify character encoding, and a reasonable default if you don&rsquo;t know</li>
<li>Dates (which only exist notes exported from the Mac OS version of Palm Desktop) can be recognized in languages other than English now. (I&rsquo;ve only tested French, since that&rsquo;s the only language people complained about, but if it doesn&rsquo;t work for others, I&rsquo;m sure somebody will let me know and supply sample data.)</li>
<li>If the importer chokes while processing a note (less likely with the above two fixes, but still possible) it continues with the rest of the notes instead of immediately giving up entirely.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.travelpod.com/travel-%0Ablog/metamatt/1/tpod.html">Sabbatical travel map</a></p>

<p>I wanted a visual display of everywhere we went on our sabbatical — ideally a
world map marked up with arrows indicating our route.</p>

<p>Looking for such a thing; the best thing I found was travelpod&rsquo;s map display,
which is a lot heavier than just a map (I didn&rsquo;t really want to create a
separate trip blog) but does the trick. (Google Maps and the other map sites I
tried are great at showing routes for connected road trips, but not flights.)</p>

<p><a href="http:/%0A/www.flickr.com/photos/metamatt/5336648336/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5210/5336648336_b605964578.jpg" alt="map" /></a></p>

<p>So: <a href="http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog/metamatt/1/tpod.html">this is the result, a map indicating our flights and
destinations</a>; I
added a few bread crumbs with links to photos from each country we visited,
but didn&rsquo;t flesh this out with tons of words and photos embedded there like
travelpod wanted me to.</p>

<p>As an aside, if you&rsquo;re into this sort of thing, Apple&rsquo;s iMovie has a pretty
cool travel visualization feature whereby it can automatically show a line
zooming from point A to point B on the globe, to connote travel as a
transition between frames of a movie or slideshow.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>iOS was born without support for multitasking, and when competing smartphone
OSes (especially WebOS and Android) added it, it was occasionally mocked for
the complexity it adds and the problems this can cause &mdash; the fact that a top
Android app is a task killer was widely used to mock the whole Android
platform, and it&rsquo;s certainly frustrating under WebOS when you&rsquo;re told you have
too many cards open and need to throw some away before you can do anything
new.</p>

<p>Problems iOS users don&rsquo;t have, true. On the other hand, at least these OSes
(a) let you run multiple tasks if you want to, and (b) have explicit support
for ending tasks you no longer want for whatever reason. (And there are
various reasons to want this: perhaps you don&rsquo;t want it using resources,
perhaps you want it to restart from its default launch state, perhaps you just
don&rsquo;t want it cluttering up your screen.)</p>

<p>Recently I got a new iPod Touch and it&rsquo;s my first experience both with iOS 4
and with an iOS device with increased memory &mdash; in short, now I can try out
the multitasking features that Apple added in iOS 4. At first blush, I really
like it; it&rsquo;s easy to switch between recently used apps and recently used apps
seem to launch more quickly than they do from a cold start; I think this is a
good improvement to the platform.</p>

<p>However, in the next week, I&rsquo;ve seen at least 2 occasions where apps got in a
bad state, and going back to the home screen and relaunching the app didn&rsquo;t
fix it (whereas it would have in iOS versions predating multitasking). Sure,
these were app bugs and not platform bugs, but I didn&rsquo;t know a way to actually
quit and restart the app, short of rebooting the whole iPod, or launching a
bunch of other apps in quick succession until it magically pages out the
offending app so the next time I launch it it&rsquo;s a clean launch (this is what I
did, and it eventually worked).</p>

<p>While writing this post, I looked around a little and it turns out iOS 4 does
have a built in task killer &mdash; double-tap Home to bring up the multitasking
tray with icons for recently used apps, then click and hold on one of these
until it wiggles and it&rsquo;ll have a &ldquo;&ndash;&rdquo; badge which will remove it from the
recently-used tray and, presumably, actually kill it. (Though I still don&rsquo;t
know how to tell which of the many icons that show up in iOS&rsquo;s multitasking
tray &mdash; if I scroll to the right, it seems to be a most-recently-used list of
every app I&rsquo;ve ever launched &mdash; is actually running.)</p>

<p>So iOS 4 is both more powerful and complex than I&rsquo;d realized, but also, it&rsquo;s
achieved parity with the oft-mocked Android multitasking feature in both
directions &mdash; now it has multitasking, but now it needs and has a task killer.</p>

<p>I find I still prefer WebOS&rsquo;s more explicit interface to multitasking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Vanessa and I just got back from a long trip during which we took and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/metamatt/collections/721576239%0A04129021/">posted
a lot of pictures</a>, mostly posting from the road, and I thought I&rsquo;d write up a
description of the gear we used and how we used it.</p>

<p>I was using both a Nikon DSLR, and a Canon pocket camera for times when I
don&rsquo;t want to carry the big DSLR. We also had a netbook running Windows 7 and
Adobe Lightroom to offload and process the photos, and an external hard drive
for backup.</p>

<p>Every day or 3 when we had some free time, we&rsquo;d offload the cameras &mdash; with
twin goals of taking a look at the photos on a larger screen, and backing
stuff up in case a camera is broken/stolen. I&rsquo;d use Lightroom&rsquo;s import
function to bring all the photos into an &ldquo;incoming&rdquo; folder, subdivided by
date, for both cameras. After I had all the photos from both cameras sitting
in the &ldquo;incoming&rdquo; folder, I&rsquo;d back up the entire &ldquo;incoming&rdquo; folder to the
external hard drive, and only then, use Lightroom to reorganize the photos by
destination, theme or group. (Importing first into this temporary &ldquo;incoming&rdquo;
folder as a staging area has two purposes: it&rsquo;s easy to do backups as above
this way, and I never need to change Lightroom&rsquo;s import settings; once the
defaults are set correctly, I just have to hit Import and then OK.)</p>

<p>Once, and only once, all the photos are copied off of the memory cards and
onto both the netbook&rsquo;s hard drive and the external hard drive, I&rsquo;d format the
memory cards in each camera.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back on the netbook, I&rsquo;d be accumulating more and more photos that
eventually need to be sorted into good and bad, the bad ones deleted, mediocre
ones ignored for now, and the good ones cleaned up, annotated with metadata,
and uploaded to my favorite sharing site (currently Flickr).</p>

<p>To do this, I&rsquo;d:</p>

<ol>
<li> Make a quick pass through each group of pictures, using Lightroom&rsquo;s flag feature to group them into 3 bins &mdash; reject for immediate deletion, unflagged to ignore for now, and pick for the good ones. Redundant/duplicate good ones are mostly allowed for now, and all picked.</li>
<li> Create a new collection, and add all the picked photos from step 1.</li>
<li> Use Lightroom&rsquo;s develop module to make them look better &mdash; recrop, correct exposure, correct lens distortion, reduce noise, whatever&rsquo;s necessary.</li>
<li> Go back through this collection carefully to pick only the photos that I like best or that best represent the story, eliminating redundant photos (picking just the best of any groups of similar photos).</li>
<li> Add location, title and caption metadata to the surviving photos.</li>
<li> Export these photos to Flickr.</li>
</ol>


<p>(Several of these steps can be done in different orders, but the more photos
you&rsquo;re working with at a given step, the more work it is… if you eliminate
duplicates in step 1, you spend less time developing them; if you add captions
or other metadata before step 4, you&rsquo;ve got more to do, though location
metadata can often be applied in bulk.)</p>

<p>All of this is a lot of work, but it goes more quickly with practice and I
don&rsquo;t know an easier way to get equal results. Also, running Lightroom on a
netbook with only 2GB of memory is an exercise in patience, but it still paid
off compared to waiting till we got home to process thousands of photos, since
our friends could follow what we were up to in closer to real time, and we
didn&rsquo;t have weeks of photo tweaking to do once we got home.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past 12 years I&rsquo;ve been a customer of Sprint, T-Mobile and
Cingular/AT&amp;T for wireless service in the US, and from this, I have a simple
view of what you get from each one. During that time I&rsquo;ve lived in the San
Francisco Bay Area and traveled pretty extensively in cities on both coasts
and in the rural Pacific Northwest, so that&rsquo;s what my coverage comments will
be based on.</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;ve never been a Verizon customer, but it&rsquo;s widely agreed that their service
is both good and expensive; it&rsquo;s easy to verify their prices are on the high
end, and friends and family who use their service like the quality, so I&rsquo;ll
repeat that viewpoint).</p>

<p>Summary: Sprint and T-Mobile are cheap; AT&amp;T and Verizon are expensive; Sprint
and Verizon have good coverage; AT&amp;T and T-Mobile have weak coverage; that
means Sprint is cheap and good, Verizon is expensive and good, T-Mobile is
cheap and weak, and AT&amp;T is expensive and weak.</p>

<p>Sprint, in 7 years of use, has always been the cheapest for the level of
service I get, and it&rsquo;s always worked fine for me. Sure, there are rural areas
where they don&rsquo;t have coverage, but in my experience their coverage is wider
than T-Mobile and equal to AT&amp;T, and anywhere they don&rsquo;t have coverage, you
can roam for free on Verizon. Voice quality has been good; usually with even 1
bar of signal strength conversations work fine. Sprint often gets dismissed as
having bad customer service, but that hasn&rsquo;t been my experience; also, in my
view, the best customer service is the one you have to deal with the least,
and I didn&rsquo;t often have a need to call them.</p>

<p>T-Mobile was priced about the same as Sprint, but their coverage was notably
worse, both in the rural Pacific Northwest, and in urban San Francisco. I had
no real complaints in 2 years as a T-Mobile customer other than lack of signal
coverage in areas that mattered to me; that&rsquo;s when I jumped ship to Cingular,
since I could bring along my existing GSM phone.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T worked OK (better than T-Mobile, no better than Sprint) with the older
phone I brought over from T-Mobile, until I got an iPhone in 2007. That
started 2 years of frustration, ultimately leading me to decide that the GSM
networks in the US haven&rsquo;t kept up in terms of network quality, and bringing
me back to Sprint. In 2 years of iPhone use, I had daily experiences with
dropped calls, incoming calls that went straight to voicemail, and garbled
voice during calls that went through, all of this often with the phone
reporting 4 or 5 bars of signal strength. Voice calls weren&rsquo;t the only
problem; often I&rsquo;d take my phone out to look up a map or kill a few minutes
reading mail or the web, and be unable to do so, so I take issue with the
general assumption that the iPhone is a bad phone but great for everything
else and so great for modern people who don&rsquo;t care about voice calls &mdash; those
people probably expect reliable wireless data, and aren&rsquo;t getting it. One
observation I made during this time was that while every carrier&rsquo;s coverage
has dead spots (they even have maps of this!), dead spots in space are pretty
easy to route around &mdash; you know where they are, and you can avoid them. But
AT&amp;T&rsquo;s network is the only one I&rsquo;ve seen where the signal quality varies
hugely in time as well, that is, where you could have perfect signal quality
at one time, and 5 minutes later in the same spot, no usable signal at all.
For me, signal quality that varies in time is far more frustrating than signal
quality that varies in space.</p>

<p>(There&rsquo;s plenty of agreement on AT&amp;T&rsquo;s dismal service quality, especially in
cities such as New York and San Francisco, and plenty of speculation on why &mdash;
maybe it&rsquo;s the iPhone itself that&rsquo;s buggy, maybe there are simply too many
users on the network &mdash; I just know that the 2 different iPhones I had were
not reliable for either voice or data use in the US, and they both worked a
lot better overseas on other networks once I unlocked them.)</p>

<p>So of the 3 networks I&rsquo;ve tried, only Sprint was cheap and good; that for me
is a compelling combination and brought me back to them.</p>
