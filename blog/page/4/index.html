  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read two extensive reviews of Microsoft&rsquo;s new Surface tablets today.</p>

<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/microsofts-first-stab-at-a-pc-surface-reviewed/">Peter Bright, writing for Ars Technica</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>They&rsquo;re covered in polyurethane that should prove hard-wearing and water
resistant (I was told that they should withstand scouring pads, though I admit
I&rsquo;m too chicken to try—we had to promise to return our review units unharmed)</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/reviews/2012/10/microsoft-surface/all/">Mathew Honan, writing for Wired</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>And it’s quite sturdy, to boot. In Microsoft’s lab, we saw Surfaces that had
been opened and closed hundreds of thousands of times. They still snapped open
and shut like they were new. We wanted to see how easy it was to break one.
It’s very possible, but you have to really try. We did manage to break off the
kickstand by gradually leaning onto it, but I had to put nearly my full weight
onto the tablet before the kickstand snapped off.</p></blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote><p>Microsoft showed us a drop test by letting a Surface fall from a chest-high
height. I duplicated this by literally throwing it at the floor, but to no ill
effect.</p></blockquote>

<p>All in the name of science, of course. I doubt Bright could have gotten in
that much trouble for taking a Brillo pad to his Touch Cover. Oh well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, it&rsquo;s come to this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67861147@N00/8052630604"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8031/8052630604_7c3946ed99.jpg" alt="IMG_1136" /></a></p>

<p>I waited a week after iOS 6 was released, asked my Facebook friends what they
thought of it, and within hours got 6 responses that all said not to upgrade
if I care about maps. Well, I do care about maps, but how bad can it be? I
wanted to see for myself, but not shoot myself in the foot on the phone I
depend on daily, so I upgraded my iPad instead.</p>

<p>Actually, the new 3D view is very cool where the data is good, and here in San
Francisco the data is good. Zooming around my neighborhood is fun and looks
great; that&rsquo;s a real win. In fact the maps overall look great, and the zooming
is much smoother than what we&rsquo;re used to with the Google-powered maps in
previous versions of iOS. How about the underlying data? Um, not so good.
Roads are (in my experience) where they belong, but addresses and landmarks
and businesses are often not. I don&rsquo;t know why anyone is surprised by this;
it&rsquo;s a very hard problem, and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/how-google-builds-its-maps-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-everything/261913/">Google has worked incredibly hard</a>
(and thrown a lot of money, human time, and computer time at acquiring and massaging the
data) to get their maps to the point we all take for granted now. The world is
very big.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s pleasant when I search for an address a mile from where
I&rsquo;m standing and get a search result for a similarly named street 1000 miles
away in Texas. That&rsquo;s what happened to me the first time I tried actually
using Maps for real, i.e. to find something whose location I didn&rsquo;t already
know. I also tried plugging in a few locations I remember from our trip to
Ireland, where iOS 5 maps (i.e. Google maps) got us everywhere we needed to
be, and Apple maps didn&rsquo;t know them; that trip would have been much harder.</p>

<p>But luckily, the built-in Maps app powered by Apple&rsquo;s fledgling data set isn&rsquo;t
your only choice, and that&rsquo;s what my screen shot above reflects. I tried the
various alternatives shown here before upgrading, and came to roughly the same
conclusions as <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/10/replacing-ios-6-maps-hands-on-with-mapquest-bing-waze-google-nokia/">this Ars Technica article</a>: Waze is neat for navigation but not a
replacement map; MapQuest is pretty unpleasant to use; the Google Maps website
actually works just fine; upon confirming that last, I decided it was fine to
upgrade.</p>

<p>More surprising to me is that it&rsquo;s Nokia who has the second-best map
experience — both data quality and interaction design — after Google. (Maybe I
shouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised. I remember reading about <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/02/calling-all-cars-measuring-traffic-using-cell-phone-data/">Nokia&rsquo;s Mobile Millenium project</a> and thinking that while their
approach seemed more like academia than industry and Google is probably
leaving them in the dust in terms of speed of deploying new features, their
very thoughtful approach especially with respect to privacy is commendable.
Clearly, they&rsquo;ve been taking this seriously.) I tried, again, punching in some
of the hotels we stayed in in Ireland, which Google could locate and Apple
couldn&rsquo;t, and Nokia found them just fine. That test involves just a few data
points, but is in keeping with a general reputation that only Google and Nokia
have decent place data outside the US.</p>

<p>So the obvious conclusion: Apple should just buy Nokia.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>2006: The first RAID/storage appliance I bought was the original Infrant
ReadyNAS NV. It was medium-expensive for its time, well-built, and at first I
liked it a lot. However a few missteps by Infrant (one about spending years
stonewalling user requests for ssh access while sitting on a MAC-address-based
backdoor password, one about essentially a product recall of the fan which if
you read between the lines just meant they&rsquo;d installed it backwards and
customers who want proper cooling should flip it around but it will get
louder), one power supply failure, and some mediocre experiences with their
generally well regarded tech support around buggy CIFS and AFP coexistence,
then the fact that Infrant sold itself to Netgear (the conventional wisdom on
which had it that there goes their tech support, although I didn&rsquo;t notice any
difference, and their jedi council is still at it today), combined with
extremely middling performance, meant when I needed more space, I went
elsewhere. (As you&rsquo;ll see, in hindsight this feels misguided; 6 years later
and the little ReadyNAS NV is still humming along fine, Infrant continues to
support it with software updates, and it&rsquo;s been far less frustrating and more
useful than my next couple purchases.)</p>

<p>2008: Elsewhere meant Promise; I bought an NS4300N. It offered a fairly
similar feature set to the ReadyNAS, but was half the price and slightly
faster. It was also of notably lower build quality, a lot more rickety and a
lot louder. Over time the firmware situation got sketchier; the product
stopped evolving; I moved it to a friend&rsquo;s house to use as offsite backup,
then slowly stopped using it; now it&rsquo;s gathering dust.</p>

<p>2010: Soured on the consumer-priced NAS market mostly due to poor performance
(Infrant and Promise had both claimed speeds of around 30MB/second but that
seems to involve way too many arcane dances and incantations involving jumbo
frames and disabling journaling and other bad ideas, even for me; configured
sanely, I see a reliable 10MB/second from the ReadyNAS, which is overkill for
music storage and backup and frustrating for anything else, so guess what? I
use it for music storage and backup), and still dreaming of fast centralized
storage for photos and videos and home directories and data I care about, I
tried a DAS solution next. The Promise DS4600, cabled via Firewire 800 to a
Mac Mini which is on all the time anyways. (The decision calculus that lead to
my original NAS purchase in 2006 involved servers that drew 100+ watts and
marketing claims that the consumer NAS units performed fine and had reasonable
AFP implementations; here in 2010 I was betting that I&rsquo;d get better
performance and correctness from the real Apple AFP server on a real (Intel
Core 2 Duo) CPU and now that only draws 10 watts.) In retrospect, this was the
worst of the bunch. On a good day it reads and writes at 50MB/sec, but on the
much more common bad day it reads and writes at less than 1 MB/sec; as
originally shipped it would somehow cause the host computer to slow to a crawl
and need rebooting every few days, spending all its time in unbillable kernel
space (how a Firewire device accomplishes this, I have no idea); a firmware
update eventually fixed that, but to this day years later, performance is
unpredictable and generally slow, especially for small random writes, and if I
reboot the host computer, the DS4600 array won&rsquo;t be visible until several
minutes after boot. Also twice the array thought there was no volume
configured (and it came back up reboot, but that&rsquo;s still pretty scary, and
meant I had to stop using this for anything important).</p>

<p>Oh, and the configuration app for Mac OS that ships with the DS4600 creates
1024 threads (for what unholy purpose, I have no idea) and causes 16 identical
copies of the mouse cursor to appear onscreen, offset vertically by 64 pixels.
Keep in mind that while I didn&rsquo;t buy this from Apple, this is a product that
Apple actually stocked and sold specifically for use with Macs, so I shouldn&rsquo;t
have been that far off the beaten path here. (This is tied with another
Promise software disaster inflicted on me a few years ago for reasons not to
keep buying their products. Their hardware seems to perform well for a low
price, but riddled with software/firmware bugs as it is, no more for me. The
other case I speak of: I bought a low-end 2-port SATA RAID controller for a
Windows PC in 2006. All configuration for this PCI card was carried out by a
Java app with an in-browser interface, meaning you need a Java VM and a web
browser to twiddle a few hardware registers on a PCI card. Also, the installer
failed to create any front door to invoke the web browser, so I had to run
tcpview to figure out what port it was listening on to invoke it. All this for
something I only had to use once, for one-shot configuration. The RAID
controller worked fine for years, but what a horrible out-of-box experience.
The resulting web UI for the PCI card and the standalone NS4300 RAID appliance
was almost identical, I can almost cross my eyes far enough to envision a
world where it made sense to do write-once-limp-anywhere for the configuration
UI, but not quite, and in no case does that excuse making me run tcpview to
figure out where to point the browser. Though to bring this full circle, this
division of labor between the embedded software development and real-OS
software development, or lack thereof, probably explains the 1024 threads the
&ldquo;SmartNAVI&rdquo; app creates, somehow.)</p>

<p>2012: Thoroughly frustrated with the DS4600 and its foibles, lack of
reliability, and unpredictable speed. And we&rsquo;re shooting lots of video of
Dominic, so I need somewhere big and fast to store video files. DAS no longer
sounds like a good idea, largely because how am I going to connect it? My
current home server, the Mac Mini, has only USB2 and Firewire 800 and those
are no longer considered fast. Apple continues to willfully ignore eSATA;
their anointed storage bus is Thunderbolt which is (still) a tiny expensive
low-volume ecosystem which tends to point back to Promise, and which is not
available on any of my current machines anyway; USB3 is starting to creep into
their machines but as of October 2012 is still inexplicably only available on
portables; there&rsquo;s just no DAS array that I could plausibly connect to my
current server and a future server and expect good performance. Now you&rsquo;re
probably wondering why I&rsquo;m talking about Apple hardware anyway; clearly they
have no desire to let us do external storage anywhere near the price-
performance of the PC world; I should just build my own box and run Linux or
Nexenta and soak in the ZFS goodness and… no thanks. I&rsquo;m crazy enough to
<a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2012/03/19/custom-built-linux-router-no-thanks-to-realtek/">build my own networking hardware</a>, but don&rsquo;t want to deal with storage hardware.</p>

<p>So…. back to NAS? The last day the DS4600 thoroughly irked me, a few hours
later Ars Technica ran <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/09/synology-ds-412-is-fast-fun-and-flexible/">this gushing review of the Synology DS-412+</a>. Sounds good to me. I ordered one (actually the 5-bay DS-1512+,
which cost hardly any more) and am setting it up now. Wish me luck. In first
impressions, the hardware is well built, it runs quieter than either the
ReadyNAS NV or the DS4600 that it&rsquo;s meant to replace, and I like that they
gave some thought to fan replacement and memory upgrades. The browser UI is a
little too flashy for its own good, but is impressive in its own way. I
haven&rsquo;t done any real performance testing yet. Wish me luck.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yeah I know, this is already well known and I&rsquo;m just piling on and
complaining. Still, it&rsquo;s annoying and worth noting. Airlines keep adding
arbitrary fees and reducing service quality. Boo. This is worse for us because
now we&rsquo;re flying with Dominic as a lap infant and the airlines are especially
poorly optimized for this, at really every level. You can&rsquo;t buy tickets the
easy way, you can&rsquo;t check in the easy way, and everything gets harder.</p>

<p>A few recent experiences that sucked:</p>

<p>Southwest: they don&rsquo;t charge for a lap infant and are generally friendly,
which is why we keep flying them. But if you have a lap infant, there&rsquo;s no way
to add him to the reservation, but you do need to get a boarding pass, which
can only be done at the full-service checkin line, which is the longest and
slowest one. They&rsquo;ve increasingly incented people to check in online and
either skip the front-of-airport counter if not checking luggage, or use the
faster &ldquo;bag drop only&rdquo; counter if checking luggage, and only people who never
travel and don&rsquo;t realize any of this, or people with unticketed infants, end
up in the longest slowest understaffed full-service checkin line that the rest
of their policies are actively trying to drive us away from. Then, we need to
gate check Dominic&rsquo;s car seat, which can only be done at the gate counter. So
every flight involves visiting both the front checkin counter and the gate
checkin counter. This doesn&rsquo;t waste just our time, but also that of the
Southwest employees and everyone behind us in line, and really nobody
benefits.</p>

<p>Aer Lingus: on our trip to Ireland, we booked our international travel from
the US into Dublin and back from London, and left undecided how and when we&rsquo;d
get from Ireland back to London. We eventually booked an Aer Lingus flight
from Waterford to London, which was easy enough (and even let us book a ticket
for Dominic with no hassle which was a pleasant surprise), but booking this
ticket on aerlingus.com also had an unpleasant surprise: they quoted the price
in euros right up till the final &ldquo;buy&rdquo; button, when they converted it to
dollars, at a rate about 8% worse than the going exchange rate. No way to opt
out of this. I&rsquo;d have been happy if they charged me in dollars at the current
exchange rate, and I would have been fine if they&rsquo;d charged me in euros and I
paid the credit card company their foreign transaction fee (around 3%), and I
would have been fine if they&rsquo;d charged me in dollars at the current exchange
rate and added a 3% currency conversion surcharge. But silently pretending the
exchange rate was significantly worse than it is: that&rsquo;s just shady.</p>

<p>United: trying to get to Mexico in December for a friend&rsquo;s wedding, Kayak
quoted us $830 roundtrip for 2 adult tickets on United, and there&rsquo;s no way to
add a lap infant through Kayak. I tried searching for the same flights on
United&rsquo;s website, where we could add a lap infant, and it came to $915, the
extra $85 breaking down as $30 for the infant seat (fine) and another $55 in
US taxes (not fine, because they&rsquo;re repeats of taxes already built into our
fare, and basically charging the same amount of tax for Dominic as for me and
Vanessa put together). I don&rsquo;t know where the tax money is going or whose
fault this is, but it sure doesn&rsquo;t seem right. So I called United to ask
whether I should add Dominic to the reservation up front and pay those taxes
or book without him and add him to the reservation after the fact, and they
couldn&rsquo;t answer the tax question but said the website won&rsquo;t let me book a lap
infant and I should definitely book without him then call back to add him.
Even though that didn&rsquo;t seem true, I was hoping the taxes would resolve
themselves more sanely that way, so that&rsquo;s what I did. Imagine my annoyance
when I call back to add Dominic to our reservation and am told they will
charge me $30 for his ticket, $55 in taxes which they can&rsquo;t explain but they
are what they are, and $25 in reservation fees for not booking online, which
they now charge even for transactions which the website can&rsquo;t do. (And while
the website seemed willing to book the lap infant as part of the reservation,
both customer service agents I talked to told me they don&rsquo;t think it works,
and that even if it doesn&rsquo;t work, that isn&rsquo;t cause to waive the $25 fee.)
Fail.</p>

<p>On a less whiny and more humorous note, I&rsquo;ll leave you with
<a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/2012/a-satire-about-the-hell-that-is-taking-a%0A-commercial-flight/">this</a>. C&#8217;mon, airlines, we just want to pay a fair price for a
fair service, no tricks or traps.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apple has been dabbling with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_independence">resolution independence</a>
in Mac OS since 2005; in 2011 they shipped double-resolution &ldquo;Retina&rdquo; displays in iPhone
and iPad, and in that year&rsquo;s Mac OS release (10.7 &ldquo;Lion&rdquo;), renamed the
tentative resolution-independence support &ldquo;HiDPI&rdquo; and capped it to a 2x
scaling factor, hinting strongly at the future release of Retina Macs. In
2012, they released the Retina MacBook Pro and soon thereafter, Mac OS 10.8
&ldquo;Mountain Lion&rdquo;, bringing the HiDPI modes out from behind the developer tools
and debug flags.</p>

<p>My question was whether Apple would ever make Mac OS usable for media-watching
purposes, connected to an HDTV, aka an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_theater_PC">HTPC</a>. Connected to our living
room 1080P LCD TV, we have an Apple TV, an Xbox 360, and a Mac Mini; the Mac
is there as an HTPC basically to handle whatever the dedicated media devices
can&rsquo;t; the list of things the ATV and Xbox can&rsquo;t handle has been shrinking
over time, but still. The pain point in this arrangement has been that if I
set the Mac Mini to full 1080P output, text onscreen is too small to read. If
I set it to 720P, text is borderline readable but still on the small side, and
images are scaled by 1.5X in the TV, so there&rsquo;s some loss of picture quality
once we get into a movie.</p>

<p>This scenario seems a pretty good match for the HiDPI modes — specifically
960x540 HiDPI, meaning text and UI elements are rendered for a virtual 960x540
resolution but the display itself is running at its native 1080P (1920x1080,
exactly double the virtual resolution in each direction) and images get to
address every pixel. (It seems faintly ridiculous to me that Mac OS had to
wait until 2012 to offer any kind of control over the size of UI elements, and
that after waiting until 2012 it arrives in such limited form; Microsoft
Windows has offered control over UI element text size since forever; in
practice apps with custom skins would often misrender some controls if you
used custom text sizes, and I suppose Apple was trying to limit exposure to
that problem by exposing such a little and late form of resolution
independence. Did it work? Read on….)</p>

<p>Note that by Apple&rsquo;s definition, a 32&#8221; 1080P display from a distance of 8
feet, across our living room, very much qualifies as a &ldquo;Retina&rdquo; display. You
can&rsquo;t see individual pixels, and both text and images ought to look pretty
darn great.</p>

<p>In my experience with the &ldquo;960x640 (HiDPI)&rdquo; mode in both Mac OS 10.7 and 10.8,
by forcing the 2X scaling factor and automatically pixel-doubling unaware
apps, Apple has successfully avoided the problem with both Windows&#8217; themed UI
font sizes and Mac OS 10.4-10.6 scaling factors where some UI elements would
be clipped to the wrong size. On the other hand, by giving me 960x540 as the
only resolution that both addresses every physical pixel and has readably
larger text, they&rsquo;ve introduced a new problem: nobody cares about making apps
actually fit on screen sizes this small. (Typically, the archaic and once-
grand XGA, 1024x768, resolution is taken as the smallest possible, and indeed
Mac OS warns you if you select a resolution smaller than that in either
direction that apps may not fit.)</p>

<p>The problem starts with Apple&rsquo;s own apps; here&rsquo;s Software Update (from 10.7)
on the 960x540 screen. (A couple notes here. First, the sad thing is this app
is not design-intensive and does not require any special UI elements; the
window itself and the individual panes are resizable; there&rsquo;s no reason it
couldn&rsquo;t run perfectly well at 960x540. Second, in 10.8 this app has been
replaced with the Mac App Store app, which does a better, but still not good,
job of fitting at 960x540.)</p>

<p>Note that the initial window size (above) doesn&rsquo;t even try to use all the
available screen height; note also that enlarging it (below) helps not at all
with the real problem.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67861147@N00/7839608226"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7258/7839608226_95d17378a9.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2012-04-05 at 6.58.45 PM" /></a></p>

<p>Hoping that 10.8 (the first OS X release conceived and shipped for Retina
Macs) might fix this oversight, I upgraded the OS on this machine. The initial
results are not pretty. The first thing you see when launching the Mountain
Lion installer:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67861147@N00/7839606716"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7267/7839606716_ea7f39b90d.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2012-08-20 at 12.58.33 PM" /></a></p>

<p>Such crisply rendered text! (Click through for a high-res version.) Nice large
cougar image! Such beautiful use of whitespace! But… where&rsquo;s that promised
Continue button?</p>

<p>(I cheated, changed display resolution to reveal the Continue button, pressed
it, then changed resolution back to 960x540 for the next screenshot.) Again,
the same problem.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67861147@N00/7839607938"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8294/7839607938_e66ef0823c.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2012-08-20 at 1.04.53 PM" /></a></p>

<p>OK, you say, but those images are still from OS X 10.7. It&rsquo;s an app designed
for and as part of 10.8, to be sure, but maybe 10.8 itself will be better?
Reboot into the new OS install, and:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67861147@N00/7839606564"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7117/7839606564_852af9b7d8.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2012-08-21 at 9.48.12 PM" /></a></p>

<p>Rats. Foiled again. At least the clickable buttons are onscreen, but the
screen was obviously cropped, and not intentionally.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67861147@N00/7839606366"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7265/7839606366_167da70f92.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2012-08-21 at 9.48.40 PM" /></a></p>

<p>No, Apple, thank <em>you</em>. (And a special extra thanks for not starting the
screen sharing daemon until after I click these two right arrows from the
local display, preventing people from upgrading their Mac OS installs
remotely. You can do the rest over screen sharing / remote desktop, but you
need a local display and mouse to get past these two screens.)</p>

<p>The real problem here isn&rsquo;t that TV-as-Retina-display-with-HiDPI couldn&rsquo;t
work, it&rsquo;s that apparently nobody cares. Nobody cares about screens smaller
than 1024x768 because nobody&rsquo;s shipping those any more; nobody cares about
making 960x540 work as a special case for TV use, because you&rsquo;re just supposed
to buy an Apple TV instead of hooking a Mac up to your TV, I guess.</p>

<p>So close, but yet so far.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since Vanessa and I have fairly similar cars, one gasoline and one diesel, I
found it instructive to compare their observed fuel efficiency now that we’ve
put a few thousand miles on each.</p>

<p>One is a 2012 Audi A4 wagon (4-cylinder 2.0 liter turbocharged gasoline
engine). The other is a 2011 VW Golf TDI (4-cylinder 2.0 liter turbocharged
diesel engine).</p>

<p>For both of these, I’ll list real-world numbers for the speeds I actually
drive, averaged across a bunch of real driving. (I wish it were easy to get
numbers like these before buying; the EPA test circuit isn’t all that
reflective of our real world driving). I’ll list the fuel mileage for 3 cases
which I find instructive:</p>

<ul>
<li>best-case I’ve seen (long-distance highway driving)</li>
<li>a typical commute from San Francisco to Palo Alto (37 miles, mostly highway)</li>
<li>the average over the entire time we’ve had the car (a mix of city driving, medium-distance commuting, and longer road trips).</li>
</ul>


<p>One thing I already knew: the diesel engine is more efficient than the
gasoline engine. Another thing I already knew: highway mileage is better than
city mileage (excluding hybrids with regenerative braking, which these cars
are not). And one thing I didn’t know, but learned from reading the Audi
owner’s manual and confirmed by real experience: short trips get worse mileage
than long trips, because mileage is worse before the catalytic converter warms
up.</p>

<p>On to the numbers (all of which come from the cars’ own trip computers).</p>

<p>Audi A4 (gasoline): average over our entire mix of driving is 25 mpg. Typical
mileage on the commute is 29 mpg. Best mileage I’ve seen for an extended
period of highway driving is 33 mpg.</p>

<p>VW Golf TDI (diesel): average over our entire mix of driving is 37 mpg.
Typical mileage on the commute is 44 mpg. Best mileage I’ve seen for an
extended period of highway driving is 51 mpg.</p>

<p>Conclusions and observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Golf TDI definitely gets better mileage than the gasoline A4. About 50% better across the board, actually. (Though there are many variables other than the fuel type; the A4 is bigger and heavier, and has all wheel drive and an automatic transmission. On the flip side, bigger isn’t necessarily worse; it’s likely more aerodynamic. And Audi claims their 8-speed automatic transmission delivers equal or better fuel economy to the 6-speed stick.)</li>
<li>The Golf TDI is more sensitive to speed than the A4; there’s more upside to driving at or below the speed limit.</li>
<li>There’s an interesting comparison to be made, for both cars, between the “typical commute” and “best I’ve ever seen” numbers. That typical commute is 37 miles starting and ending with a few non-highway miles; the average mpg starts low (non-highway), climbs as I get on the highway, then climbs further as the catalytic converter warms up. By the time I arrive, the running-total average has pretty much stabilized, but only barely. And the going rate on Highway 280 is often around 75 mph, well above the optimum speed for maximum efficiency (closer to 60 mph for both these cars, as far as I can tell).</li>
<li>The “best I’ve ever seen” results derived from getting on the highway and driving just over 60 mph for a longer distance — so the steady state average mileage is higher (because of lower speed) and contributes more to the final average (since most of the time was spent in the steady state after the catalytic converter warms up).</li>
<li>Our observed around-town mileage for both cars is significantly worse than the EPA “city” estimate, because these trips tend to be very short, full of stop-and-go, and at suboptimal speeds. I think the EPA cycle tries to account for the latter 2 factors but not the first one. This is true for the diesel car as for the gasoline one, and is a further argument for electric vehicles for in-city driving.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apple <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22tablet+market%22+%22ipad+market%22">pretty much owns the tabletmarket</a>
<a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/08/10/this-people-mean-say-ipad-dominating/">today with the 10&#8221; iPad</a>, but the
<a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/#/7">Nexus 7</a>
<a href="http://speirs.org/blog/2012/8/2/thoughts-on-the-google-nexus-7.html">is here and good</a>
(in my opinion, the first viable answer to &ldquo;why buy this instead
of an iPad&rdquo;), and meanwhile, rumors of a 7-ish-inch &ldquo;iPad Mini&rdquo; or &ldquo;iPad Air&rdquo;
are <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/07/this_ipad_mini_thing">heating</a>
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/08/ipad_mini_even_througher">up</a>.</p>

<p>My family has both a Nexus 7 and an iPad, and I find myself using the Nexus 7
more than the iPad, for four reasons. This makes me think that the iPad Mini
rumors are likely true. In a nutshell, while a 7&#8221; tablet can&rsquo;t do everything a
10&#8221; tablet can do, the 7&#8221; tablet <em>can</em> do the things where I&rsquo;d choose a tablet
over a laptop or desktop, and it can often do those things better than the 10&#8221;
tablet.</p>

<p>First, the reasons that limit what I do on a tablet vs a laptop or desktop:</p>

<p>1) the iPad (like all iOS and Android devices) <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5934539/the-tablet-problem">doesn&rsquo;t have user accounts,
yet my wife and I share the iPad</a>,
and I mostly leave it lying around the house. So I haven&rsquo;t given it
credentials for all the individual apps and services I use — in some cases
because Vanessa and I would both want to use them; in some cases because I&rsquo;m
not comfortable leaving that credential cached on a device I don&rsquo;t keep close
tabs on. So some of the apps I use the most on computers and my phone, and
would potentially use on a tablet, I don&rsquo;t use on the iPad: email, Facebook,
Evernote. The ability to have user accounts or profiles (and have
<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/07/all-or-nothing_1.html">some apps available without unlocking an identity, and other apps behind an identity</a>)
would make a big difference here; I have to assume this will happen at some point.</p>

<p>2) typing on any of these onscreen keyboards is frustrating, so I tend to just
wait till I get to a computer for serious input. This hit me when I was
watching my son Dominic learning to crawl: at first he was perfectly happy to
drag himself around on his belly with his arms, his legs trailing behind; as
he got closer to real crawling, he started getting frustrated and impatient
with the previously good-enough belly slide, because he had the yearning for
real speed. So I feel about typing on a tablet: I can do it, and if I were
trapped on another planet with no other means of self-expression I would
surely use it, but if I have thoughts spanning more than a sentence or two,
I&rsquo;d rather just wait till I get back to a real keyboard to pour them out
effortlessly. (And I realize I can use a separate keyboard with an iPad: it
basically negates this disadvantage, but also the portability advantage vs a
laptop.)</p>

<p>Then, the reasons the Nexus 7 succeeds handsomely at <a href="http://bitingtongue.blogspot.com/2012/07/the-simple-task-that-was-my-charge.html">the modest task that is its charge</a>:</p>

<p>3) the form factor. It&rsquo;s significantly more portable, and significantly easier
to hold in one hand; notably this makes it much better for reading on trains
and reading in bed. Given the apps I&rsquo;ve already stopped using (due to #1 and
#2), these are the primary ways I want to use a tablet. The iPad&rsquo;s bigger
screen is an advantage, but not enough to make up for the reduced
portability/holdability.</p>

<p>4) while Android as a whole doesn&rsquo;t feel as fluid or natural as iOS, on both
platforms the OS is designed to pretty much get out of the way once you&rsquo;re in
an app; that&rsquo;s to say your real impression of the platform is driven by the
apps. The main apps I use on the Nexus 7 are surprisingly good. The first-
party Google apps (gmail, Google Reader, Google Maps) are better than on iOS;
the builtin Chrome browser is very good; the third party apps I use the most
(Kindle, Instapaper, Evernote, Facebook) are all available and good. So the
overall impression the Nexus 7 leaves is very good.</p>

<p>So, iPad Mini…?</p>

<p>There are warts to Android — even with Jellybean, scrolling and touch
interaction don&rsquo;t feel as smooth as iOS always has. The back button is a
disaster; you never know what it&rsquo;s going to do. The app selection isn&rsquo;t as
wide as iOS, and even where equivalents are available, they&rsquo;re often rougher.
Plus, I&rsquo;ve already paid for a fleet of iOS apps. While it&rsquo;s a tradeoff with #4
above, I have a feeling an Apple 7&#8221; tablet could be even better than the Nexus
7.</p>

<p>What all this means is that given the way I use a tablet, I find the Nexus 7
does everything I want it to, far cheaper and more portably than the 10&#8221; iPad.
I look forward to seeing what Apple does with the rumored iPad Mini (or iPad
Air).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://askavwsalesguy.com/blog/2012/07/30/volkswagen-send-tdi-%20owners-a-gift.html">VW&rsquo;s safety/recall department just sent me these janky stickers</a> for
<a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2012/03/07/diesel/">my 2011 Golf TDI</a>. The accompanying
notice wasn&rsquo;t phrased as a recall, exactly, but given the return address, I
can&rsquo;t help but think they&rsquo;re trying to avoid liability, and they must be
having a larger than normal problem with people using the wrong fuel.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67861147@N00/7825635162"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8303/7825635162_89f9e96767.jpg" alt="Stickers for VW Golf TDI fuel door" /></a></p>

<p>They specially called out loaning the car to friends or family; I haven&rsquo;t had
any problems with borrowers putting in the wrong fuel, but when I have loaned
out the car I&rsquo;ve reminded people 3 times that they shouldn&rsquo;t refuel it but if
they do they need to use diesel (the fact the car goes 500 miles between
refueling helps a lot here).</p>

<p>So now my fuel filler area looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67861147@N00/7825635632"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8293/7825635632_b1431ac662.jpg" alt="VW Golf TDI fuel door after stickers" /></a></p>

<p>(Note how the stickers are wrinkly and poor-fitting, and this isn&rsquo;t only
because I applied them poorly.)</p>

<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is, why don&rsquo;t they just <a href="http://forums.tdiclub.com/showthread.php?t=320751">use green plastic for the fuel cap itself</a>? Not green
as in tree hugger; green as in the color of the handle on almost all diesel
fuel pumps in the US. (I realize the green handle isn&rsquo;t a legal requirement or
a universal convention, and notably BP doesn&rsquo;t follow it, but it&rsquo;s still
pretty widely recognized.) That would be a much more obvious visual cue to
remember which fuel to use. Doesn&rsquo;t this make more sense and look both cleaner
and more obvious?</p>

<p><a href="http://forums.tdiclub.com/showthread.php?t=320751"><img src="http://im1.shutterfly.com/media/47a1d831b3127ccefd00a357f97b00000030O08CZtXDdy5ag9vPgo/cC/f=0/ps=50/r=0/rx=720/ry=480/" alt="VW TDI fuel door with green aftermarket cap" /></a></p>

<p>I wondered this when I first bought the car; I wonder this every time I refuel
it; I especially wonder this every time I see these stickers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s almost September, <a href="http://www.imore.com/apple-iphone-5-and-ipad-mini-event-planned-september-12-iphone-5-release-date-september-21">so time for a new iPhone</a>.</p>

<p>What’s coming this fall from the software side (<a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/">iOS 6</a>) is mostly public already.</p>

<p>What’s coming this fall from the hardware side is just rumor, but seems to
revolve around <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/05/bigger_display_iphone_thing_wwdc">a larger 16:9 screen</a>,
<a href="http://thetechblock.com/the-unibody-iphone">a unibody enclosure</a>, and
<a href="http://itsmorereal.tumblr.com/post/29480903669/the-foolproof-dock-connector">a smaller replacement for the dock connector</a>.</p>

<p>Here, with no connection to reality, the above rumors, or any inside
information, is what I <em>wish</em> Apple would add on the hardware side:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wireless charging (a la <a href="http://www.hpwebos.com/us/products/accessories/touchstone-technology.html">Palm Touchstone</a>, or, like, every electric toothbrush ever). Since iOS 5 added over-the-air upgrades and wireless cloud backup and iTunes sync, pretty much the only reason I need to plug my iPhone into a cable is to charge it. Even better than a smaller “foolproof” dock connector is no connector.</li>
<li>USB 3. Probably a no-brainer, but now that the iPhone shoots HD video, it accumulates some pretty darn big files. After charging, the only other reason I plug my phone into a cable is to transfer photos and videos; sure, this could be done over Wi-Fi, but for gigabyte video files, neither USB 2 nor Wi-Fi is satisfyingly fast. USB 3 should be.</li>
<li>NFC. <a href="http://www.google.com/wallet/">Google is turning Android phones into wallets</a>; <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/#passbook">Apple is adding this new Passbook feature in iOS 6</a>; it would work better with NFC. But even more than replacing my wallet, <a href="https://twitter.com/metamatt/status/237615159928057856">I’d like my phone to replace my keychain</a>, and NFC would help with that too.</li>
<li>Water resistance. How many iPhones (or other phones, music players, cameras, or other devices that could be replaced by iPhones) have you seen destroyed by water? Me, a lot. I’m not a hardware engineer, but there aren’t all that many openings on an iPhone (especially if they’re about to redesign the biggest one anyway); the battery is sealed inside; I wonder how hard it would be to make iPhones survive at least casual contact with water. (Apple’s gone to the trouble of <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3302">adding a special moisture sensor to detect liquid damage and rule it out of warranty coverage</a>; wouldn’t it be nice if neither they nor their customers had to worry about it?)</li>
</ul>
