  <div class="entry-content"><p>In summer 2009, Comcast rolled out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOCSIS#Speed_tables">DOCSIS
3.0</a> in the Bay Area,
including my neighborhood in San Francisco. Specific offerings included speeds
as high as 50mbps/10mbps up/down, and a pretty decent price on 30mbps/6mbps.</p>

<p>So: I abandoned <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/07/state-of-the-last-mile-%0Ainternet-connection-year-2008/">my Astound 18/2
connection</a> and signed up for Comcast 30/7. That was
September 2009. Looking back, I see that it was only 4 months later that I
signed up for <a href="http://pingdom.com/">pingdom monitoring</a> of my home IP address.
That&#8217;s a bad sign &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t need to monitor something that was working
properly, would I?</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time traveling in the middle of 2010 so I didn&#8217;t realize
quite how bad it was getting, but it was getting bad &#8211; the <a href="http://stats.pingdom.com/sh6fgl3lqqrd/150515/history">Comcast
connection would drop out
entirely</a> a couple times
a month, then a couple times a week, then almost daily, getting worse and
worse over time. I don&#8217;t remember thinking it was really bad until November
2010, but looking back at the data, the problems dated all the way back to
January.</p>

<p>Click on the <a href="http://stats.pingdom.com/sh6fgl3lqqrd/150515/history">Pingdom history link for the pretty
graphs</a>, which
unfortunately don&#8217;t tell the whole story: they show the amount of uptime (or
downtime), but the problem is more insidious. At first, the connection
failures would happen at night or when I wasn&#8217;t home, and would fix themselves
after a few hours, and I just assumed the whole network was down. Over time,
as this happened more and more, sometimes when I was home, and I gained
familiarity with the problem, it acquired a very distinct signature: when I
noticed an Internet connectivity failure, I&#8217;d ping the modem on its LAN
address (192.168.100.1), it would fail to respond, I&#8217;d reboot it by unplugging
and restoring power to it, and it would work fine immediately after reboot.
This looks a lot less like a problem with the network itself and a lot more
like a problem with my modem. So, Pingdom sees very little downtime because
each time it goes down, if I&#8217;m home I immediately notice and bring it back up
&#8211; it&#8217;s the number, not the length, of the outages that&#8217;s annoying me. You can
click on the month links in the Pingdom status page to see the details;
December 2010 through February 2011 sure isn&#8217;t pretty, with about 10 outages
per month.</p>

<p>So I arrived at a succinct description of the problem: modem suddenly stops
carrying traffic; at this point it also stops responding to ICMP or HTTP
requests on its local address. Reboot. It comes back fine. Speaking as a
software engineer, this looks like a bug in the modem firmware &#8211; something
goes wrong and the modem crashes. But I have no way of telling what went
wrong, since the modem doesn&#8217;t have any useful logs or diagnostics accessible
to me (even though I own the modem, its firmware and operational parameters
are controlled by the network provider, namely Comcast, not me).</p>

<p>I tried calling Comcast to see if they had any suggestions, but instantly lost
a lot of faith in their monitoring acumen when they said they couldn&#8217;t see any
history of problems, at a time when the modem was actually unplugged. I tried
replacing the modem, but a brand new modem (different brand, Zoom) failed the
same way within days. (I went back to the original modem, a Motorola SB-6120,
since it reboots much faster, and given how often I have to reboot it, that&#8217;s
actually an important feature. Plus it was already paid for.) I tried calling
Comcast and had them send a troubleshooting tech out, twice. Both times, the
tech measured the signal at the modem, said it looked great, then for good
measure went around inspecting wiring (and the first time replaced a
splitter). The problem persisted, albeit less frequently. Meanwhile, a few
more calls to Comcast support yielded only suggestions to remove every
splitter in the path (which is weird because (a), I didn&#8217;t realize that
splitters are the root of all evil, but apparently everyone who&#8217;s worked on
cable networks considers them the first thing to check, and (b), most
customers have to be using splitters &#8211; how else are you supposed to connect
your cable modem and your TV at the same time?).</p>

<p>I do have to hand it to the first Comcast tech, who not only replaced one
splitter but found an uncrimped connector on one end of a homemade cable (made
by, er, me). It&#8217;s funny to me that this poorly made cable had no effect on
speed or measurable signal quality at a given time, and not all that much
effect on reliability, since the cable modem connected via that cable worked
at a good speed for weeks or months between outages. But I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s better
to have that cable connected tightly. I&#8217;m also at a loss to explain why poor
wiring causes modem crashes &#8211; it seems much more likely to cause signal
degradation that causes persistent speed loss; it&#8217;s hard for me to see how
(without measurably degrading the signal) it can occasionally just crash the
modem. But hey, I&#8217;m not a cable modem designer. Maybe the bad wiring or rogue
splitter would occasionally push the modem outside some operational parameter,
electrically, and the modem responds by entering some untested area of its
firmware and locking up. Who knows. Now they&#8217;ve removed all the splitters and
then put back exactly one professionally installed one, checked the cabling,
measured the signal and it all looks good, and yet the problem persists.</p>

<p>Summary: the problem persists, and at this point Comcast charges me extra
every time they send a tech out to not fix it. Right now, I&#8217;m just living with
an Internet connection that forces me to reboot the modem once a week when it
crashes.</p>

<p>Pros: fastest Internet connection available in my area; pretty cheap at
introductory rate; serious upload speed; I haven&#8217;t seen any speed degradation
due to other customers on the same cable &#8211; I get full speed any time of day
I&#8217;ve tried.</p>

<p>Cons: Flaky connection; Comcast customer support and policies (no servers,
per-month cap of 250GB, past bad behavior including throttling, entire Comcast
address block is on the <a href="http://www.spamhaus.org/pbl/">Spamhaus PBL</a> so my NAS
can&#8217;t email my Yahoo account to tell me about firmware upgrades); listening to
<a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/01/26%0A/reason-number-7-its-weird-getting-internet-service-from-a-cable-company/">ads for pay-per-view boxing matches</a>
when calling tech support; opaque pricing (between bundles and introductory
rates, just try using Comcast&#8217;s website to figure out how much it actually
costs).</p>

<p>Summary: The network itself is competently run on the best technology
available in this area, but nobody knows how to troubleshoot my problem and
it&#8217;s apparently not worth it to Comcast to care for the price of one consumer
connection.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I moved between houses in 2008, since I was moving anyway it seemed like
a good time to re-evaluate my options for Internet providers.</p>

<p>In this neighborhood of San Francisco, I actually have a lot more choices than
are available in most of the USA: 2 cable providers (Comcast &amp; Astound),
first-party DSL from AT&amp;T, or 3rd-party DSL over AT&amp;T&#8217;s wires.</p>

<p>I wanted speeds faster than DSL (the only affordable DSL connections topped
out at 6mbps/768kbps), so I decided to try cable. The 2 cable providers
offered similar speeds at the time, and I&#8217;d heard bad things about Comcast, so
I signed up with Astound.</p>

<p>Unlike telephone wires (one company has a local monopoly and owns all the
wires, but is required to share the wires for rental by other companies, hence
the existence of 3rd-party DSL), cable companies don&#8217;t have to share their
wires, that I&#8217;m aware of. That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s no 3rd party cable internet, and
most areas don&#8217;t have multiple cable providers. But this area does. So, there
are 3 different sets of wires running along the poles along my street (4 if
you count AC power): Comcast coax carrying Comcast signals, Astound coax
carrying Astound signals, and AT&amp;T twisted pairs carrying who-knows-who&#8217;s
signals. There was already a Comcast wire running to my building, but not an
Astound wire, so when I first signed up, they had to run a new wire.</p>

<p>They did it wrong. I didn&#8217;t realize at first, but over the first 2 weeks, my
Internet connection would be reliable and plenty of fast most of the time, and
then every couple days would break entirely for half an hour or so. I called
Astound a couple times and they tried various troubleshooting purely from
their dispatch center and couldn&#8217;t find any problems; eventually they sent a
tech guy to my house, but he decided the problem was with the wiring which he
couldn&#8217;t reach. It turns out that Astound, as the newest company on the pole,
is also high man on the pole, as in their wires are mounted higher than the
others; also, they use a combination of their own employees and independent
contractors as service techs, and the guy they&#8217;d sent this time was a
contractor. His ladder wouldn&#8217;t reach as high as the Astound cable, so he had
to call a real Astound guy with a cherry-picker truck. Finally the real
Astound guy showed up, replaced the cable from my house to the main line on
the poles, and showed me that the original cable had a big gash in it, and
basically as it moved in the wind could make or entirely break the electrical
connection. And yet, with a physical connection so tenuous, it worked fine
most of the time.</p>

<p>After that, I didn&#8217;t have any more speed or reliability problems for the next
year.</p>

<p>Pros: pretty fast (18mbps/2mbps down/up); pretty cheap (especially at the 1st-
year introductory rate); worked fine after the first problem was resolved;
tech support was easy to reach and pretty easy to deal with.</p>

<p>Cons: shoddily run. Example 1: the original broken wire they gave me, and the
service tech they sent who couldn&#8217;t reach the wire. Example 2: they forgot to
bill me for 3 months, then noticed and reacted by just turning off my account,
which got my attention to call them pretty quickly &#8211; but it&#8217;s not like I was
failing to pay their bills; they were failing to bill me. Example 3: they had
bogus reverse-DNS entries, so that my IP address would reverse-resolve to a
hostname that forward-resolved to some other IP address, which made it hard to
log into various remote servers by ssh as sshd looks askance at such
tomfoolery.</p>

<p>Anyway, I stuck with this connection for a little more than a year, until
Comcast rolled out DOCSIS 3 in this area, opening the door to faster speeds.
Faster uploads, especially.</p>

<p>One note is that I never saw the purported disadvantage of cable, where the
medium and associated bandwidth is shared among a whole neighborhood, and the
rated speed is high but actual speed decreases when your neighbors are doing
anything &#8211; I got the rated speed pretty much all the time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In 2003 when I moved to San Francisco, I didn&#8217;t look around too hard but just
signed up for the <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/03/31/state-of-the-last-mile-%0Ainternet-connection-year-2001/">Speakeasy DSL connection that I had wanted
before</a>, and which was actually available at my new
address.</p>

<p>I kept that connection for 5 years until I moved in 2008, and it worked out
pretty well, though the speed was more impressive for 2003 than for 2008. Said
speed: 6mbps down, 768kbps up, the fastest I&#8217;ve seen deployed in the US for
standard ADSL (not ADSL2+).</p>

<p>The good: the connection was reliable; Speakeasy was easy to deal with; their
tech support people were clueful; their policies were customer-friendly (no
caps, no restrictions on server hosting or sharing my network with others);
pricing was transparent and up-front. (Some of these shouldn&#8217;t even count as
benefits, but compared to a lot of the competition, they are, so I list them.)</p>

<p>The bad: it was expensive ($116/month for &#8220;naked&#8221; DSL with a static IP and no
phone line); no faster speeds were available. (They eventually rolled out a
15mbps ADSL2 service that would reach me, but the cost was really high &#8211; over
$200/month.)</p>

<p>When I first moved in and got this service, I chose it because it was the
fastest DSL connection available, I&#8217;d heard bad rumors about cable modems not
reaching their advertised speed because of neighbor traffic (which I&#8217;ve since
found to be untrue, but that&#8217;s a story for another time), and I wanted to deal
with a company whose priority was the data network, not propping up an aging
TV or telephone business. I was pretty happy with this over the years, but by
2008, I probably would have bailed on DSL and gone to cable internet even if I
hadn&#8217;t moved.</p>

<p>(Note: all of the Speakeasy experiences described here were true at the time,
before Speakeasy was acquired by Megapath. While I haven&#8217;t been a customer
since, I don&#8217;t think all of these advantages are true any more; namely, the
DSL lines have usage caps and it&#8217;s no longer possible to get a straightforward
price quote from their web page. RIP, customer-friendly policies.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In 2001 I lived in residential Los Altos Hills in a small rental cottage on
the edge of a larger piece of property. Other than that tiny cottage, it&#8217;s a
pretty expensive neighborhood these days, but also pretty remote, and again
the only available last-mile Internet connection was DSL, and with a pretty
long loop length at that.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d heard good things about Speakeasy, so I filled out their sign-up page,
gave them my address, and their system did whatever lookups it does and
decided it could serve me, so I signed up and scheduled an install. Then just
before the install date a few days later, I got a message from them saying
(paraphrased) &#8220;Er, we know we offered you you a nice fast ADSL connections for
$50/month, but it turns out the PacBell &#8220;wiring&#8221; connecting your house to the
phone network is actually just tin cans and string, or possibly rusty piano
wire, and in any case is useless for ADSL… but would you be happy with SDSL,
144kbits in each direction, for $200/month?&#8221;</p>

<p>No, not really, I wouldn&#8217;t be.</p>

<p>Actually, I don&#8217;t have to paraphrase, because I still have the email from
Speakeasy:</p>

<blockquote><p>Your order has been canceled due to pair gain on the line and needs to be
downgraded to 144k IDSL. Pair Gain is the multiplexing of a certain number of
phone conversations (signals) over a limited number of facilities. Basically
you have a couple numbers, and so does your neighbor, but guess what? You both
use the same CO facilities to talk on. Very bad for DSL.  If you are still
interested in service, please see<a href="http://www.speakeasy.net/pricing/">[http://www.speakeasy.net/pricing/](http://w
ww.speakeasy.net/pricing/)</a> for the 144k
IDSL speed and it&#8217;s price difference from the service you originally
requested.</p></blockquote>

<p>They couldn&#8217;t offer any way to get my lines upgraded; just the observation
that the wiring wouldn&#8217;t sustain a modern ADSL connection and changes to the
wiring were out of their hands.</p>

<p>Long story short: I signed up for PacBell DSL service, and they delivered it
with no drama. It was pretty much the same price and speed as what Speakeasy
was offering but found themselves unable to deliver.</p>

<p>Over the same wires, right? Or maybe not. My theory is that PacBell had bad
and good wires running to my neighborhood, and they were happy to switch their
own DSL customers over to new shiny wires but relegate Covad/Speakeasy
customers to the old rotten wires.</p>

<p>(As an aside, looking through other emails from the same time frame, I&#8217;m
amused to see that before giving up and going with PacBell, I also tried
signing up for two different services from Sprint which I&#8217;d forgotten existed
&#8211; &#8221;<a href="http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Sprint-%0ABroadband-Direct-Goes-Offline-July-31-94556">Sprint Broadband Direct</a>&#8221; which was a 1.5mbps line-of-
sight wireless link, and &#8221;<a href="http://www.networkworld.com/archive/2001/126613_10-22-2001.html">Sprint
ION</a>&#8221; which
was some ill-fated ATM-over-DSL technology that was heavily touted for a short
period but was never actually available in my area.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the fall of 2000, my last year at Stanford, I lived with a group of friends
in one of <a href="http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/mo%0Argue/news/1996_Sep_11.DEAD.html">Rob Levitsky&#8217;s Dead Houses</a>. While most of the Dead Houses already had
shared DSL connections, this specific house was new to this capacity and
didn&#8217;t. We called up PacBell and asked for a DSL line; they said it would take
3 months.</p>

<p>(Seriously, here we are in residential Palo Alto &#8211; in the heart of Silicon
Valley during the tech boom &#8211; and the fastest last-mile Internet connection
available is 1.5 megabit DSL and even that has a 3 month waiting period.)</p>

<p>One of the friends moving into the new house had previously been living in
another Dead House right across the street, and it turned out that the DSL
line for that house was in his name and attached to his phone number. He
wanted to keep the phone number, and PacBell was happy to move the line to the
new house immediately, but then neither house would have Internet for 3
months.</p>

<p>So, like any self-sufficient group of tech-savvy geeks, we took matters into
our own hands. We strung an Ethernet cable across the street, connecting the
houses (there was enough tree cover that you could barely see the cable). One
cat5 cable has 4 twisted pairs of wire, and the slower variants of Ethernet
only need 2 pairs. So we connected one pair from this cable to the incoming
phone line at the old house, moved the DSL modem across the street to the new
house and connected it to the other end of that pair, then set up a NAT router
at the new house, put an Ethernet plug on 4 of the remaining wires in the long
cable, and used 2 of the remaining pairs to share the NAT router back across
the street so the old house didn&#8217;t lose Internet access.</p>

<p>The cable crossing the street in the trees was probably illegal, and running
both phone and Ethernet on different pairs in the same cat5 cable is not
exactly encouraged by the Ethernet spec, but it all worked fine.</p>

<p>For about 6 months. Until a squirrel chewed through the cable.</p>

<p>Oh well. It was fun while it lasted. I don&#8217;t remember what we did after that,
but I think the severe backlog at PacBell had eased and we were able to get
each house its own DSL line relatively quickly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In honor of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2011/03%0A/world-backup-day-what-are-you-doing-to-make-sure-youre-covered.ars">World Backup Day</a>, here&#8217;s a
description of my current backup strategy:</p>

<p>My desktop computer backs up to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Time Machine to local drive</li>
<li><a href="http://www.crashplan.com/">CrashPlan</a> to a separate server in my house which hosts a Promise DS4600 RAID array</li>
<li>CrashPlan to a friend&#8217;s house in another state, where I stashed another Promise NS4300 RAID array</li>
</ul>


<p>My laptop backs up to CrashPlan to the server in my house, only.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t really like Time Machine for local use, had even worse experiences
with it on my LAN (my Mac Pro would frequently kernel panic on resume from
sleep, and it hasn&#8217;t done that since I moved the TM drive local), and it
doesn&#8217;t even try to work across the WAN. And TM is slow: even for local use,
it seems like TM is almost always running or &#8220;cleaning&#8221; even if few files have
changed since the last run &#8211; it will often take > 10 minutes to back up what
it reports as 3MB of data (I haven&#8217;t used the trick described in the article
above to dial back Time Machine from its default hourly backups, and intend to
try that now).</p>

<p>CrashPlan has a lot of advantages over Time Machine (in addition to working
with computers other than Macs) &#8211; it mostly works across the WAN, across
networks and firewalls, and it doesn&#8217;t take nearly as long to run.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t see the objections to offsite networked backup these days, assuming
you have a decent Internet connection. Several different services have
unlimited storage for $5/month, CrashPlan among them, but CP one-ups the
others by also offering a free option if you host the storage yourself (or a
friend does it for you). As for speeds, I have a 5mbps upstream connection and
was able to back up about 300GB from scratch in about 10 days. The incremental
backups for whatever I change in a day have no trouble running overnight. This
is a DOCSIS 3 cable connection; if you have DSL your upload speeds are
probably 3x to 10x slower and that could be painful; if you&#8217;re lucky enough to
have fiber your upload speeds are probably 10x faster and this is a no-
brainer; anyway I wasn&#8217;t wholly expecting 5mbps to be fast enough to make
backups painless but was pleasantly surprised. I look forward to the day when
we can take that level of speed for granted.</p>

Evernote</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.evernote.com/2011/03/24/evernote%E2%80%99s-three-laws-%0Aof-data-protection/">Evernote&#8217;s Three Laws of Data
Protection</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Everything we do at Evernote follows these three basic rules:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Your Data is <em>Yours</em></p></li>
<li><p>Your Data is <em>Protected</em></p></li>
<li><p>Your Data is <em>Portable</em></p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Like what I said about <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2010/05/19/kellan-elliott-mccrea-%0Aon-data-portability-at-flickr/">Flickr&#8217;s similar
pronouncement</a>, this is totally the right approach for
companies that want to be trusted with your data. I almost hesitate to heap
praise on these companies for just doing what&#8217;s right, since (as I said
before) this is basically the minimum standard that should be acceptable and
it should be the norm, but it&#8217;s not really the norm, and Evernote and Flickr
are two companies that treat their users and their data better than the norm,
so, sure, let&#8217;s continue to praise them.</p>
