  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently by visiting now we&#8217;re slipping in just under the window for the
legendary Argentinian beef… people are complaining already it&#8217;s gone down in
quality and up in price just in the last year, but they expect it to keep
getting worse. The reason is a combination of the American feedlot system
taking over, and bad government subsidy policy which means there&#8217;s no money in
beef and too much money in soy… Argentina is now actually a net <em>importer</em> of
beef now (mostly from Uruguay). And the people I talked to were not happy
about that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Argentine national parks are really expensive for foreigners. Admission tends
to be something like $75, per person, per day &#8211; unlike in the US where
national park admission is usually good for an entire vehicle for a week. (If
you aren&#8217;t familiar with Argentine currency, here&#8217;s a crash course: the unit
of currency is the peso, and there are currently about 4 Argentine pesos to
the US dollar. The peso symbol is the $, so to avoid confusion, I&#8217;ll prefix
the $ symbol with the country code, either AR$ for pesos or US$ for US
dollars.)</p>

<p>Vanessa and I have visited 3 different national parks so far - Parque Nacional
Iguazu, Parque Nacional Tierra del Fuego and Parque Nacional de los Glaciares.
We visited each park for 2 days, and since there are 2 of us, and all of the
admission fees are per person per day, that means we had to buy 4 tickets &#8211;
conveniently matching the 4-to-1 ratio between pesos and dollars. Thus,
admission to Glaciares is AR$75 for a single ticket, but for the two of us to
visit on two consecutive days it cost us US$75.</p>

<p>Iguazu was also AR$75 per person per day, or US$75 for our 2-day visit, and
Tierra del Fuego was AR$65 per person per day, or US$65 for our 2-day visit.</p>

<p>Further: Argentine national parks have 3 different prices depending on where
you&#8217;re from &#8211; residents of the same province as the park pay the least, other
Argentinians pay slightly more, and foreigners pay a lot more. That seems
somewhat fair since (a) foreigners don&#8217;t pay taxes and (b) they mostly come
from more expensive or richer countries.</p>

<p>But, this still stings in comparison to the US: the less visited parks cost
something like US$10, and the most popular and expensive (say Yellowstone)
something like US$25. However, that gets your whole family in for a week. And
there&#8217;s an all-access pass good for all national parks for a year (this used
to be known as the Golden Eagle pass; now it&#8217;s called Access), which is US$80.
That&#8217;s sounding like a better and better deal compared to Argentina, and as
far as I know it&#8217;s available to foreigners as well.</p>

<p>(Maybe there&#8217;s some all-access pass for Argentine parks that I don&#8217;t know
about? As it stands, we&#8217;ve racked up US$215 in park admission fees in just 2
weeks!)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re entertained by finding patterns in noise, meaning in chaos &#8211; even
false meanings &#8211; and especially if you&#8217;re a English-speaking rap-listening
Burning Man-attending engineer &#8211; perhaps you&#8217;ll be as amused by these
acronyms and airport codes as I am.</p>

<p>EZE &#8211; the Buenos Aires international airport, Ezeiza, practically screams
&#8220;straight outta Compton&#8221;.</p>

<p>BRC &#8211; the Bariloche airport, or the Black Rock City airport. (If you do a
Google search for &#8220;BRC airport&#8221;, both pop up in the top 3.)</p>

<p>FTE &#8211; the El Calafate airport or, if you&#8217;ve worked in Silicon Valley and had
to read any resumes or job postings, a full-time engineer.</p>

<p>AC and DC &#8211; the equivalent of BC and AD in English, meaning Ante Cristo and
Desde Cristo. In English, we use AC and DC to refer to different kinds of
electric current, but also the rock band (whose name, judging by their
lightning-bolt logo, was inspired by electricity). But since they also have a
Genisis-inspired song (Let There Be Rock), who knows &#8211; this comes full circle
back to the Spanish Biblical meaning for AC/DC.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/reviews/2010/11/kindle-3-e-book-readers-%0Ago-mainstream.ars">Really good take on the e-book state of the
union</a></p>

<p>Nate Anderson has a really good description of the current state of the e-book
world, as shown by the Kindle 3 &#8211; the device, and also the issues surrounding
whether to buy/borrow/read books on paper vs electronically.</p>

<p>He points out one subtle issue which I think is really important for the
adoption of e-books. Consider downloadable music, which really took off with
the introduction of the iPod and its &#8220;rip, mix, burn&#8221; mentality, showing that
you could bootstrap your new pure-electronic library by converting your
existing music library, and then go on buying music in either the old physical
format (CD) or new downloadable format. With e-books, you have to choose one,
and the choices bifurcate; as Anderson writes &#8220;it appears that all but the
youngest of us are doomed to go through life with two different codexes,
physical and electronic.&#8221;</p>

<p>I know this matters for me &#8211; I like reading on Kindle, but often miss having
access to a book I already have on paper somewhere.</p>

material?</a></p>

<p>On the one hand, it&#8217;s silly to use class action lawsuits as the tool to
address software bugs, but on the other hand, if Apple&#8217;s going to publish an
update this bad and then actively prevent people from just going back to the
other version, what other recourse do upset customers have?</p>

<p>Having seen the issue firsthand &#8211; how horribly sluggish an iPhone 3G became
after upgrading from iOS 3.1 to 4.0 &#8211; I can see how people would get really
frustrated. I&#8217;m sure Apple just saw this is a bug to fix in the next update
(iOS 4.1 is said to fix it, though I haven&#8217;t tried it yet), but for people
whose daily-use phone was horribly sluggish for a couple months while they
waited for that upgrade, it&#8217;s hard to excuse Apple for not letting them
downgrade back to 3.1 in the meantime.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m now traveling internationally and right before I left I got a Kindle 3 to
replace one I&#8217;d dropped in the river. One of the unexpected benefits of the
new model is the web browser is based on WebKit and is actually functional and
useful for most sites (the browser in previous models was much more limited
and less useful, and I say this is an unexpected benefit of the new model
because for the most part, Amazon brings new software features to the old
models; I don&#8217;t know why the new browser which is just software is only
available on the new model).</p>

<p>Another side benefit of the Kindle 3 is the built-in, free-to-use 3G wireless
access works internationally. That&#8217;s pretty huge when you consider the hoops
and/or expenses you have to jump through to get a cell phone working with
wireless 3G data internationally. It wouldn&#8217;t be that surprising or useful if
all the Kindle could do with 3G data is buy stuff from Amazon &#8211; which was
basically my experience with the old model &#8211; but now that the web browser is
useful, well, watch out world.</p>

<p>Anyway, so one of the things I&#8217;ll occasionally do with this new Kindle is
check on Facebook from wherever I am that I don&#8217;t have other internet access.
Right away, I found that the full-fledged facebook site
(<a href="http://www.facebook.com">www.facebook.com</a>) tends to crash the Kindle
browser. (So do a lot of other sites that render complicated pages. Hey, they
do call the browser an &#8220;experimental&#8221; feature.) That&#8217;s annoying, so let&#8217;s
avoid that site. Strike 1. What other options do we have?</p>

<p>Well, there&#8217;s the old &#8220;mobile&#8221; facebook site (m.facebook.com), which I think
was designed for really low end browsers like mobile phones, before the iPhone
came along and redefined mobile phones as something that could maybe have a
useful browser. I tried that on my Kindle, and it loads really quickly, but
text input doesn&#8217;t work at all, so you can&#8217;t post status, search for friends,
or really do much of anything. Strike 2.</p>

<p>And, there&#8217;s also the newer &#8220;touch&#8221; facebook site (touch.facebook.com),
intended for smarter phones (<a href="http://www.facebook.com">www.facebook.com</a>
redirects here on iPhones). This one, it turns out, works just great in the
Kindle browser.</p>

<p>So there you have it: the full-fledged site crashes, the mobile site exposes
bugs with text input, but the touch site works fine. Hopefully Amazon will fix
the other issues, but in the meantime, just use the touch site if you browse
Facebook from Kindle (I changed the bookmark for &#8220;Facebook&#8221; to point to
touch.facebook.com).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just started using Tumblr; here are a couple things I want to do but can&#8217;t
figure out how.</p>

<p>1) Backdating posts. I have some things I wrote a while ago and never
published (anywhere); I&#8217;d like to publish them here but use the date I wrote
them, not the date I publish them now. I&#8217;d like the backdated date to be used
both for ordering posts in my blog, and shown as the date for the post. I do
see that Tumblr lets me set the date for posts, with &#8220;publish on…&#8221;, and if I
google for &#8220;tumblr backdate post&#8221; I see people discussing use of that for
backdated posts, but even if I set the date for a new post to something a
month in the past, it still shows up at the top of my blog labeled &#8220;1 minute
ago&#8221;. (Note this backdating behavior is the same thing you&#8217;d want if you were
importing an existing blog from somewhere else into Tumblr.)</p>

<p>2) Reblogging stuff from my personal blog to a family blog. I see that Tumblr
lets you have multiple blogs from one account, and multiple authors for one
blog. So I set up a personal blog, and a family blog; I&#8217;d like to repost some
but not all of my own blog posts into the family one. And I see that Tumblr
likes (and probably invented?) this concept of reblogging. So it seems I&#8217;d
like to be able to reblog my personal posts into the family bog. However, the
&#8220;reblog&#8221; button doesn&#8217;t show up on my own posts.</p>
