  <div class="entry-content"><p>Vanessa and I visited Machu Picchu yesterday and today; beyond visiting the
ruins of the Inca citadel itself, we also climbed the higher of the two
surrounding peaks, Montaña Machu Picchu.</p>

<p>While at the top, we sat down to rest and enjoy the view for a while; Vanessa
was drawing and I was reading, leaned up against a convenient boulder. I
noticed but didn&rsquo;t fully appreciate that there was a smallish hole under the
boulder on which I was leaning, leading to a largish cavern, about which more
later.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the &ldquo;before&rdquo; setup: note iPhone already starting to crawl out of left
pants pocket.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5167/5262183014_9382f249cf_z.jpg" alt="Before
sacrifice" /></p>

<p>To make a long story short, as I stood up to leave, the iPhone launched itself
out of my pocket, well, really, just slid a few inches, then hung on the
surface of the ground for maybe a fraction of a second &mdash; these things always
happen in slow motion &mdash; as Vanessa and I, still in slow motion, perceived:
iPhone on ground, proximate hole in ground, iPhone continuing to slide toward
hole, Matt&rsquo;s hand grabbing madly at where the iPhone had just been fractions
of a second before, iPhone entering hole, iPhone swallowed by hole &mdash; then
there remained just the peaceful gaping maw of hole.</p>

<p>I mean, it could have gone very differently, but it didn&rsquo;t, and suddenly the
phone was gone, down the hole. I looked down the hole and it was visible, but
way out of reach &mdash; maybe 4 feet down &mdash; possibly retrievable with a fishing
net or one of those grab-it-for-me things elderly people use, but we had
neither, we&rsquo;re a couple hour hike from even a modicum of civilization, and it
was starting to rain. I tried to fashion a net out of the hood of my raincoat
and a stick Vanessa found, but squandered my one chance, knocking the phone
farther down and out of reach.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the &ldquo;after&rdquo; scenario: note me sticking as much of my head and one
shoulder as will (not much) fit through the hole under the rock, floundering
around trying to reach the phone.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5162/5262183112_114dcf5a7d_z.jpg" alt="After
sacrifice" /></p>

<p>Anyway, hopefully this is not a major international environmental disaster &mdash;
littering in a national park, as it were &mdash; we did try pretty hard to get it
back, but without advanced technology or a trained monkey, it wasn&rsquo;t
happening. As for the phone, I&rsquo;m sorry to see it go, but it was already pretty
severely injured &mdash; due to a previous accident involving water, the vibrating
ringer and internal speaker were broken, meaning it worked great as an iPod
Touch but poorly as an actual phone handset; also the wi-fi radio range was
severely compromised, probably by my repair efforts when drying it from said
unfortunate water accident &mdash; suffice it to say this was already on its last
legs. RIP. With luck, it may make an interesting archaeological find for
someone in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just found a useful answer on <a href="http://askville.amazon.com/">Amazon Askville</a>
and wanted to vote it up. It says you have to be signed in to vote, so ok,
I&rsquo;ll sign in. It&rsquo;s Amazon, so I should already have an account, right? Not
quite.</p>

<p>On the sign-in page, it says &ldquo;Amazon Askville is an Amazon company that uses
Amazon for credential verification&rdquo;, and asks for a username and password.
Looks like Amazon username and password would work, right? So I enter those,
and it just says no. Then I click the create account button, and then there&rsquo;s
a link to sign in with Amazon credentials, so I enter the same Amazon username
and password again and that works.</p>

<p>So to summarize: Askville&rsquo;s initial signin page implies it uses Amazon
credentials, but doesn&rsquo;t, but actually does after 2 extra clicks which aren&rsquo;t
particularly intuitive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Say you&rsquo;re at a friend&rsquo;s house, or in a hotel or cafe, and they have a wi-fi
network you haven&rsquo;t used before, and you try to connect, and it&rsquo;s password
protected so you get asked for the password.</p>

<p>If you already know the password, great, you enter it and join the network and
go about your business. Let&rsquo;s say you don&rsquo;t know the password, so you ask your
friend or a clerk or waiter; they give you the answer a minute later, and you
enter it, and your computer fails to join. What happened?</p>

<p>If you wait too long between when the wi-fi network asks for the password and
when you provide it, the join request always fails, tells you an error
occurred, and doesn&rsquo;t ask again.  I think there&rsquo;s a challenge in the initial
association response that expires so a client isn&rsquo;t allowed to take that long
to associate, but your computer could know it&rsquo;s been that long, and
reassociate before using the credential you provide.  Or at least just tell
you you&rsquo;ve taken too long and dismiss the auth dialog.  Or at least show a
useful error message and bring back the auth dialog when it fails.  But no, it
just acts like you gave the wrong credentials, and leaves you to figure out
the problem. (OK, even if you don&rsquo;t figure out the underlying problem, the
natural thing is to just try again and that will work, but it&rsquo;s a waste of
human effort.)</p>

<p>(As far as I know, Windows, iOS and Mac OS all act like this.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you subscribe to a periodical on Kindle, each issue of the periodical can
only be viewed on one Kindle device, ever.</p>

<p>In some ways, Amazon makes this pretty obvious up front, but in other aspects,
not at all.</p>

<p>First, unlike Kindle book content, periodical content has a designated device,
and only downloads to that device, and once one Kindle device has downloaded
one issue, other Kindle devices can&rsquo;t. This is pretty clear in the purchasing
UI, e.g. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-%0AAtlantic/dp/B000IMVNQU">here for The Atlantic</a>, and click &ldquo;how subscriptions work&rdquo; near the Subscribe
button.</p>

<p>Second, also unlike Kindle book content, periodical content is only available
on real Kindle devices, not the software app for Windows, Mac OS, iPhone,
Android, etc. (This is supposed to change soon.)</p>

<p>Third, and this is the part that I find non-obvious, once a given Kindle
downloads an issue from a subscription, it can&rsquo;t be transfered to another
Kindle. This means that if you break, or lose, or sell, your Kindle, and buy
another one, all your old subscription issues are gone. I find this annoying
because I didn&rsquo;t know this when I subscribed &mdash; I thought I was buying
something to keep as long as I wanted, and of course an individual Kindle
device isn&rsquo;t going to last forever.</p>

<p>Plus, I can&rsquo;t find anywhere that this limitation is documented publicly
(unless you count the terse &ldquo;Issues are only available for download to one
Kindle&rdquo; statement as covering this case, which I don&rsquo;t). I found out when I
broke my Kindle and bought another one &mdash; Amazon makes it easy to transfer the
subscription itself to the new Kindle device, so future issues show up on the
new device, but it said nothing about the old issues. I then asked Kindle
customer support how I could transfer the old issues I paid for, and they said
I can&rsquo;t. Since then, I&rsquo;ve asked them 3 times if they can point to a public web
page with a policy statement on this, and every time they just answer that old
subscription content can&rsquo;t be transfered.</p>

<p>I suspect this comes down to license revocation, and that they never built a
revocation capability into their DRM technology, and this is just another one
of the lame facts of life about DRM. It&rsquo;s not the first time that Amazon&rsquo;s
Kindle DRM in particular has reminded people that you&rsquo;re not really buying
content, you&rsquo;re just licensing it, and <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/personal_t%0Aech/drm/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218501227">the licensing party has undue control
over what they&rsquo;ve licensed you</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Why is the Kindle keyboard so awfully hard to type on? It sure seems like
Amazon wants us to use it &mdash; it&rsquo;s part of the original Kindle vision (it&rsquo;s
been there since the first version), it&rsquo;s visually prominent and uses a lot of
space on the device, and it&rsquo;s necessary for a lot of Kindle features beyond
plain reading.</p>

<p>But I find it horrible, and they haven&rsquo;t improved it since the first version.</p>

<p>a) the layout is bad &mdash; the rows are aligned vertically, not offset like real
keyboards. So, N is under H instead of between H and J; I often hit M instead
of N. (A lot of smartphone keyboards like Blackberry, Treo, Pre do a better
job in less space!)</p>

<p>b) The key feel is bad &mdash; hard to tell when you&rsquo;ve pressed a key (again,
smaller cell phone keyboards do better)</p>

<p>c) The Delete and Enter keys are easily confused &mdash; they&rsquo;re both in the wrong
position (with respect to real keyboards), and enter&rsquo;s symbol looks almost
like a backspace symbol &mdash; to the point where even after years of using it, I
still mistake enter for backspace.</p>

<p>d) The Kindle drops keystrokes when typing at all quickly. I realize the e-ink
display can&rsquo;t keep up with rapid changes, but I don&rsquo;t see why the Kindle can&rsquo;t
buffer faster than I can type.</p>

<p>All this means that I avoid typing any more than I have to, and when I do
type, it&rsquo;s slow going and results in a lot of errors.</p>

<p>If this was the best it&rsquo;s possible to do in the space they can afford to
dedicate to it, I&rsquo;d be more understanding, but given how many cell phones have
demonstrated smaller keyboards that are much easier to type on, I wish Amazon
would just borrow that knowledge.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since we were going to be spending so much time on the road this year, Vanessa
and I bought a $300 netbook to bring with us. (Rationale: I didn&rsquo;t want to
bring something heavier or more expensive all over Asia and South America; I
also don&rsquo;t want to type any of my account passwords into any computer I don&rsquo;t
control.)</p>

<p>Well, I found netbooks starting at $300, but at the time I was looking (March
2010) there were newer models available with double the battery life, which
seemed useful for traveling, costing $350… and that&rsquo;s with Windows 7 Home
Basic edition, and 1GB of memory.</p>

<p>First things first, running Windows 7 in 1GB is an exercise in pain. (Well,
running it on a slow netbook will be anyway, especially once we try to do
photo processing in Lightroom, but so it goes; again we didn&rsquo;t want something
heavier or much more expensive. But the memory we can do something about.) So
we upgraded it to 2GB of memory for $40 &mdash; this part at least we figured out
before we left home.</p>

<p>What I hadn&rsquo;t predicted was how limiting the Home Basic edition of Windows
would be. Two Windows features that are really valuable for travelers sharing
a computer are</p>

<ul>
<li><p>fast user switching, so two people can switch between their own accounts without completely logging out</p></li>
<li><p>internet connection sharing, so if one person is using the computer, the other can <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2010/11/24/windows-connection-sharing-for-travel-network-access/">use a spare smartphone like an iPhone over the same network connection</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>and it turns out these features are only available in the Home Premium edition
of Windows 7. Microsoft lets you upgrade between editions at any time, but
charges $70 for the privilege.</p>

<p>So, the $300 netbook turned into a $450 netbook. It works a lot better now,
though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK, this rules &mdash; ask and you shall receive.</p>

<p>You can tell the Kindle to show foreign language translations, instead of
same-language definitions, with its builtin dictionary feature. This is
something I had reason to want, wondered if it were possible, and it turns out
that it already exists.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the background: one of my favorite books in any language is
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Labyrinths-Directions-Paperbook-Jorge-%0ABorges/dp/0811216993/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1290785837&amp;sr=8-1">Labyrinths</a>, by Jorge Luis
Borges, an English translation of works originally published in Spanish as
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Labyrinths-Directions-Paperbook-Jorge-%0ABorges/dp/0811216993/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1290785837&amp;sr=8-1">Ficciones</a>. (OK, that&rsquo;s an
oversimplification &mdash; Labyrinths is not exactly a translation of Ficciones;
both are collections of short stories, but not exactly the same set of Borges
stories. Still, Labyrinths is the preeminent English-language translation of
Borges, and it&rsquo;s a great collection of stories.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read the English translations several times (the stories are extremely
rich and deeply layered and get better with multiple rereadings), and it&rsquo;s
long been a goal to eventually read them in Spanish, but I don&rsquo;t know Spanish.
Now, however, I&rsquo;m learning Spanish; also it turns out that Labyrinths is not
available for Kindle, but Ficciones is. I figured this was a good excuse to
jump in and give it a try.</p>

<p>Once I started reading the stories in Spanish, I found it possible but
extremely slow going, as reading in a tentatively acquired foreign language
always is. Partly the problem is slowing down and making sure comprehension
occurs, and partly it&rsquo;s vocabulary. Looking up each unfamiliar word in a
separate dictionary is really slow and takes you out of the original book, but
if you skip too many unfamiliar words without understanding them, it&rsquo;s hard to
understand the overall writing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Kindle has a builtin dictionary lookup feature, where you move
the cursor over any word and it shows the definition of the word (at the edge
of the screen, and you can push a button to jump to a longer definition). This
feature shows English definitions of English words, but driven by the above
need to improve my Spanish vocabulary, I started wondering if the Kindle
dictionary feature could show me Spanish &ndash;> English translations instead of
English &ndash;> English definitions.</p>

<p>I did a web search for this, and immediately found some questions and answers
indicating it is possible &mdash; the technique boils down to: buy a dictionary
with the translations you want, then from the Home screen&rsquo;s menu go to
Settings, then from the Settings screen&rsquo;s menu go to Change Primary
Dictionary, and select the new dictionary. (<a href="http://blogkindle.com/dictionary/">This process is nicely documented
here</a>, but the dictionaries they link to
are in the wrong direction. I bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Merriam-Websters-Spanish-%0AEnglish-Translation-Dictionary-%0Aebook/dp/B002ROKQUG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2&amp;s=digital-%0Atext&amp;qid=1290789984&amp;sr=1-1">Merriam-Webster Spanish-English
Translation Dictionary</a> instead.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not perfectly seamless &mdash; you have to pay for a separate dictionary for
each language, buy the dictionary ahead of time, tell the Kindle to use it,
and only one dictionary is active at a time &mdash; but still, I expect this to be
immensely helpful both for my reading of Ficciones and for my learning of
Spanish overall.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&rsquo;s what I really want from the mobile phone market: I want to be able to</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Buy my choice of phone at a fair market price (not one distorted by
subsidies)</p></li>
<li><p>Use that phone on whichever network I want</p></li>
<li><p>Pay for the network service I actually use, at a fair market rate (not
restricted by available fixed-usage plans)</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Right now, especially in the U.S., none of this is true. Phone purchases are
heavily subsidized by mandatory service contracts, hiding the actual cost of
the phone and allowing the unsubsidized price to be absurdly high. Phones are
generally sold locked for a specific network, preventing you from using it
with other networks &mdash; even after you&rsquo;ve paid off the subsidy, if any. And in
the US, in addition to this artificial economic barrier, we&rsquo;ve managed to
build separate networks using different incompatible technology (Sprint and
Verizon run CDMA networks; AT&amp;T and T-Mobile run GSM networks). Finally, the
networks rope you into paying a fixed monthly cost regardless of how much or
little you use their service, by pricing ala carte service (for voice and SMS,
but especially for data) ridiculously high.</p>

<p>So the status quo, especially in the U.S., is that you have to pick your phone
from what&rsquo;s available for your choice of network (or vice versa); then you get
a shiny fancy new phone for a deceptively low price (but woe to you if you
break it or lose it or have it stolen or want to upgrade on your own
schedule); then you pay back that deceptively low price in your monthly fees
for the next couple years (and woe to you if your usage patterns don&rsquo;t map
closely to one of the available &ldquo;plans&rdquo;).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not holding my breath, but the above 3 freedoms are what I wish for.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Windows has this &ldquo;internet connection sharing&rdquo; feature which lets you share an
existing network connection over one network adapter by turning on NAT,
forwarding and DHCP services on additional network adapters.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2010/11/24/windows-%0Aconnection-sharing-for-travel-network-access/">This is really useful</a>, but Windows&#8217; UI for
enabling/disabling it is really lacking compared to, say, Mac OS X.</p>

<p>When I want to share the ethernet connection over wi-fi: I have to both set
the wifi adapter to connect to a private ad-hoc network, and set the wired
adapter to shared. This requires 2 separate steps in two completely different
places in the network configuration UI.</p>

<p>Then, when I want to use the computer as a wi-fi client, I have to turn both
of these off, again requiring 2 separate steps in 2 separate places.  If you
just associate to a real wifi network but leave sharing enabled for the
Ethernet connection, then Windows acts as dhcp server and not client on the
wi-fi connection.  (And if you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong, the symptom is pretty
non-obvious &mdash; Windows will let you join wireless networks and report it&rsquo;s
connected, but no traffic will flow.)  So you have to dig around in 2
different places and remember to change both or you get a broken config.</p>

<p>The Mac OS way of saying, all in one place, &ldquo;share this [wired] through that
[wifi]&rdquo;, and if &ldquo;that&rdquo; is &ldquo;wifi&rdquo;, asking the name to share it under and
setting up an AP, works far better.</p>

<p>Another wart in Windows&#8217; ICS:: the result is an ad-hoc network which not
everything is compatible with (my iPhone works until it sleeps, but loses its
DHCP address on wake; Pre doesn&rsquo;t even show it).</p>
