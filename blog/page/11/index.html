  <div class="entry-content"><p>Visiting parents for the holidays, I wanted to show a slide show from my and
Vanessa&#8217;s recent travels, and wanted to show this on their big screen TV, not
on a little laptop screen.</p>

<p>The slide show was happily residing on 2 different Mac laptops; the older one
has a DVI port and the newer one has a Mini DisplayPort and the big screen TV
in question only has HDMI inputs and I couldn&#8217;t find my cables/dongles to
convert either DVI or Mini DisplayPort to HDMI.</p>

<p>Enter my brother&#8217;s newish Dell laptop, which conveniently has a real full-
sized HDMI port and can, gasp, be connected to any modern TV with a standard
HDMI cable. Better yet, it actually includes audio-out over HDMI (which I
think would hypothetically also be true of my newer MacBook Pro&#8217;s DisplayPort,
albeit requiring a newer/smarter dongle than the one I have and couldn&#8217;t
find).</p>

<p>The problem showed up when testing different display resolutions and sound
support and getting confused by the fact my brother had silenced all the
system sounds on his laptop, I unplugged and replugged the HDMI cable between
the laptop and TV maybe 20 times, and eventually the TV stopped showing
anything at all. Based on past experience with Windows having flaky support
for eternal displays, the first thing I did was reboot the laptop, at which
point the external display still wasn&#8217;t working.</p>

<p>Then I rebooted the TV, and the image came right back. So score one for
Windows &#8211; it&#8217;s now no longer the weak link in the chain, when talking to
external displays (think of all the conferences/presentations you&#8217;ve seen
start 10 minutes late because the presenter was screwing around with Windows
display settings trying to get it to talk reasonably to the projector) &#8211; at
least in this case. (Though my brother then asked if it&#8217;s really a win for
Windows if it&#8217;s sending out signals that crash TVs.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you use both Flickr and Adobe Lightroom, and upload from Lightroom to
Flickr using <a href="http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/flickr">Jeffrey&#8217;s &#8220;Export to Flickr&#8221; Lighroom
Plugin</a>, you might find that
sometimes images don&#8217;t get uploaded, or get uploaded and forgotten.</p>

<p>I typically find this out, for example, when I edit keywords or other metadata
for a bunch of images, then use the File->Plug-in Extras->jf Flickr Extras
command to resync the metadata at Flickr for hundreds of images at once. Often
I&#8217;ll be told &#8220;the metadata for 471 images was updated but 2 images were not
found at Flickr&#8221;.</p>

<p>At this point, you need to know how to do 2 things:</p>

<ul>
<li>assuming the images were really uploaded, you want to reassociate the Lightroom copy with the Flickr copy</li>
<li>if that fails because the images were not really uploaded, you want to identify them and actually upload them to Flickr</li>
</ul>


<p>The first one is easy; also in the jf Flickr Extras dialog, there&#8217;s a command
&#8220;associate images&#8221;. Try this. If you&#8217;re lucky, it&#8217;ll just work. If it fails,
you need an easy way to tell which images it failed for; that&#8217;s where this tip
comes in:</p>

<p>Switch to grid view if you&#8217;re not already there. Select all of the images in
the batch you&#8217;re working with. Make sure the filter bar is shown (this can be
toggled in the View menu: &#8220;Show Filter Bar&#8221;), then filter by text, and filter
on: Text | Any Searchable Plug-in Field | Doesn&#8217;t Contain | &#8220;flickr&#8221;. This
works because the jf Flickr plugin adds a field with Flickr in the name to any
image it uploads.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now, to make sure people are even more continually conscious that we need to
be terrorized by terrorists, we&#8217;re going to advertise this in Wal-Mart. Two
different blogs I read linked to this news last week: <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/12/07/walmart-%0Ahomeland-security">John Gruber compared it
to the movie Brazil</a> and <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/12/department_of_h_2.html">Bruce Schneier compared it to the book
1984</a>.</p>

<p>These comparisons remind me of a joke I used to make during the Bush
presidency: people were intended to look at works of dystopia sci-fi like
Brazil and 1984 and see a cautionary tale; the neo-cons looked at these same
works and saw an instruction manual.</p>

<p>Of course, here we are in 2010, Bush and the neo-cons are out of office, and
yet the madness continues.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just bought a new iPod Touch to replace<a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2010/12/03/iphone-3g-%0Asacrificed-to-gods-of-machu-picchu/"> the iPhone 3G I sacrificed to the
gods of Machu Picchu</a>.</p>

<p>I took it out of the packaging, turned it on, and found: it immediately
demanded that I connect it to iTunes, and was entirely useless until I did so.</p>

<p>This is ostensibly so that I can restore it from a backup of an existing iOS
device if I&#8217;m upgrading from an older one, and also so that I can sync music
and videos and apps and stuff to it, and also so that it gets backed up.</p>

<p>Still, without ever syncing music etc. from a computer, it&#8217;s useful purely
over the (wi-fi) network connection; I wanted to add my email and iTunes App
Store credentials and then I&#8217;d be able to download apps, check email, and
browse the web. Or, I should say, <em>would</em> be useful for all this if I didn&#8217;t
have to go find a computer and plug it in just to do nothing.</p>

<p>(Plenty of other similar devices &#8211; Palm Pre, Amazon Kindle, and, I presume
though I don&#8217;t own any, Android phones &#8211; manage to be useful out of the box
and over the air without ever needing to connect to a computer, though of
course you can do this optionally if you want to, up front or later, to sync
media.)</p>

<p>To make things worse, I&#8217;m not home; I&#8217;m visiting my sister and her family. So
I had to borrow her computer just to activate my iPod Touch. Even though
iTunes asked me what iTunes account to use to register the device &#8211; it was
signed in as her, and I signed out and signed back in as myself &#8211; it used my
account only for the registration step, but on the iPod Touch itself, it went
ahead and configured her iTunes account, which I had to undo later.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also somewhat dreading that when I do get home, and want to add music to
this iPod, I&#8217;ll have to sync it with a computer I actually own, and that doing
so will make me have to start over with all the things I did today &#8211; adding
email accounts, installing apps, and then configuring my credentials for these
apps. I hope not.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just reread the first 3 Dune books (Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune).
Consistent with my memory from the 1st reading, the first is awesome and the
second one much weaker. The author&#8217;s son, Brian Herbert, wrote an afterword to
the first book and introductions to the second in third, and in all three of
these he finds it necessary to defend the second book, but, in my opinion, not
for the right reasons &#8211; what he apologizes for is the tearing down of the
hero, which I didn&#8217;t mind.  What&#8217;s wrong with the second book is that it just
doesn&#8217;t have the depth of intrigue or scope or carefulness that makes the
first so epic. It&#8217;s like the actual writing fell victim to trying to prove a
point. Maybe this echoes an ironic meta-consistency with the idea that heroes
are fallible, but it&#8217;s not actually good for the book.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s really a matter of deftness &#8211; books one and three hint subtly at things
beyond what&#8217;s stated, leaving much to the imagination and inspiring the
reader, while book two generally describes things over-plainly, coming off
stilted, and not taking advantage of the overall air of mystery.</p>

<p>The third book, on the whole, is a return to the layered intrigue and epic
scale that made the first book so strong.</p>

<p>Side note: I read all of these on Kindle, and the Kindle rendition of the
first book is horrible &#8211; chock full of typos and formatting errors. This is
especially ironic given that the first book has been reissued as a vaunted
&#8220;40th anniversary edition&#8221; and costs more; the sequels haven&#8217;t been given the
&#8220;reissue-with-lots-of-formatting-errors&#8221; treatment, and are both cheaper to
purchase and a lot easier to read. More on this later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This might be confusing because all of the following can be called &#8220;Machu
Picchu&#8221;, so I&#8217;ll try to be unambiguous.</p>

<p>Machu Picchu is the famous Inca city, abandoned and now ruins that you can
visit as part of a national park.  To get there, you generally arrive by train
to an inhabited Peruvian city called Aguas Calientes (also known as Machu
Picchu Pueblo). Also, the whole site is named for a mountain also named Machu
Picchu &#8211; Montaña Machu Picchu, to be unambiguous &#8211; which you can climb once
inside the park.</p>

<p>As many visitors do, we arrived by train into Aguas Calientes, then took the
bus up to Machu Picchu itself, then climbed Montaña Machu Picchu. I want to
know the beginning and ending elevations of this climb, but can&#8217;t find a good
source of information on this.</p>

<p>Note that when you&#8217;re there, it&#8217;s obvious that Machu Picchu is easily a few
hundred meters above Aguas Calientes, and Montaña Machu Picchu is easily a few
hundred meters above that.</p>

<p>However, when I start web searching to find the elevations of Machu Picchu
(the Inca city) and Moñtana Machu Picchu (the mountain towering above all
this), I find a lot of inconsistent data; combining local sources and
guidebooks with the top couple Google hits for &#8220;elevation Machu Picchu&#8221; and
&#8220;altitude Machu Picchu&#8221;:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Lonely Planet guidebook says that Aguas Calientes is at 2400 meters above sea level, and doesn&#8217;t give elevations for the other two.</p></li>
<li><p>There&#8217;s a sign at the Aguas Calientes train station saying it&#8217;s at 2410m.</p></li>
<li><p>Wikipedia claims <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machu_Picchu">Machu Picchu is &#8220;about 2450 meters&#8221;</a> above sea level, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aguas_Calientes,_Peru">Aguas Calientes is 2040m</a> above sea level.</p></li>
<li><p>Encyclopedia Britannica&#8217;s article starts with a note explicitly addressing the variation in estimates of elevation; they then state <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/354719/Machu-Picchu/354719suppinfo/Supplemental-Information">both 2440m and 2350m as numbers given by Peruvian officials for Machu Picchu</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://sacredsites.com/americas/peru/machu_picchu.html">sacredsites.com article on Machu Picchu</a> claims the mountain top as 9060 feet (2760 meters), but it&#8217;s not entirely clear which mountain top they mean &#8211; Montaña Machu Picchu, or Huayna Picchu, which is much lower.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.theperuguide.com/machu_picchu/machu-picchu-altitude.html">The Peru Guide&#8217;s Machu Picchu FAQ</a> says Machu Picchu is 2430m.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So, no coherent answer. Wow. This can&#8217;t really be that hard to answer these
days. Now I wish I&#8217;d taken a GPS unit with us and measured this myself!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I mostly share my photos on Flickr, but want the uploads announced on Facebook
so that my friends know about them. Flickr has long offered a way to do this;
it hasn&#8217;t always worked great for me. (It worked up until a few months ago
when Yahoo redid their notification system to use Yahoo Pulse; after that it
stopped working; I disabled the feature and re-enabled it and it started
working again, then stopped working again, and I didn&#8217;t have time to figure
out why.)</p>

<p>Lately since it hasn&#8217;t been working at all for me but has for my friends, I
decided to get to the bottom of it, and started with Flickr&#8217;s help system. I
found it somewhat noteworthy that of the help topics linked <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/">directly from the
top of their help system</a>, which asks &#8220;What are
you having trouble with&#8221;, &#8220;Facebook updates&#8221; is the 2nd thing in the list.
Good, so I&#8217;m not the only one.</p>

<p>Anyway, this link rapidly takes you to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/with/facebook">a list of troubleshooting
steps</a>; kidding aside, this is
really useful. It basically says to make sure your images are public, safe and
searchable, shows you how to verify this for your existing images and change
it for future uploads, and says if this doesn&#8217;t work, unlink and relink your
Yahoo and Facebook accounts (which was the big hammer I already tried twice,
once with and once without success.)</p>

<p>Looking at my own recently uploaded images, they were marked safe and public
but not searchable. Huh? Flickr&#8217;s settings confirmed that I haven&#8217;t disabled
this globally; hmm; it must be something to do with the way I&#8217;m uploading the
images, using <a href="http://regex.info/blog/lightroom-goodies/flickr">Jeffrey&#8217;s &#8220;Export to Flickr&#8221; Lightroom
Plugin</a>. First I check the
settings I&#8217;m using and they look fine; then I check Jeffrey&#8217;s release notes
and sure enough, there was a bug with image visibility, fixed newer than the
version of the plugin I&#8217;m using.</p>

<p>Hopefully, once I update the plugin to the version that fixes this bug, it
actually works end to end for me now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Vanessa and I visited Machu Picchu yesterday and today; beyond visiting the
ruins of the Inca citadel itself, we also climbed the higher of the two
surrounding peaks, Montaña Machu Picchu.</p>

<p>While at the top, we sat down to rest and enjoy the view for a while; Vanessa
was drawing and I was reading, leaned up against a convenient boulder. I
noticed but didn&#8217;t fully appreciate that there was a smallish hole under the
boulder on which I was leaning, leading to a largish cavern, about which more
later.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the &#8220;before&#8221; setup: note iPhone already starting to crawl out of left
pants pocket.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5167/5262183014_9382f249cf_z.jpg" alt="Before
sacrifice" /></p>

<p>To make a long story short, as I stood up to leave, the iPhone launched itself
out of my pocket, well, really, just slid a few inches, then hung on the
surface of the ground for maybe a fraction of a second &#8211; these things always
happen in slow motion &#8211; as Vanessa and I, still in slow motion, perceived:
iPhone on ground, proximate hole in ground, iPhone continuing to slide toward
hole, Matt&#8217;s hand grabbing madly at where the iPhone had just been fractions
of a second before, iPhone entering hole, iPhone swallowed by hole &#8211; then
there remained just the peaceful gaping maw of hole.</p>

<p>I mean, it could have gone very differently, but it didn&#8217;t, and suddenly the
phone was gone, down the hole. I looked down the hole and it was visible, but
way out of reach &#8211; maybe 4 feet down &#8211; possibly retrievable with a fishing
net or one of those grab-it-for-me things elderly people use, but we had
neither, we&#8217;re a couple hour hike from even a modicum of civilization, and it
was starting to rain. I tried to fashion a net out of the hood of my raincoat
and a stick Vanessa found, but squandered my one chance, knocking the phone
farther down and out of reach.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the &#8220;after&#8221; scenario: note me sticking as much of my head and one
shoulder as will (not much) fit through the hole under the rock, floundering
around trying to reach the phone.</p>

sacrifice" /></p>

<p>Anyway, hopefully this is not a major international environmental disaster &#8211;
littering in a national park, as it were &#8211; we did try pretty hard to get it
back, but without advanced technology or a trained monkey, it wasn&#8217;t
happening. As for the phone, I&#8217;m sorry to see it go, but it was already pretty
severely injured &#8211; due to a previous accident involving water, the vibrating
ringer and internal speaker were broken, meaning it worked great as an iPod
Touch but poorly as an actual phone handset; also the wi-fi radio range was
severely compromised, probably by my repair efforts when drying it from said
unfortunate water accident &#8211; suffice it to say this was already on its last
legs. RIP. With luck, it may make an interesting archaeological find for
someone in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just found a useful answer on <a href="http://askville.amazon.com/">Amazon Askville</a>
and wanted to vote it up. It says you have to be signed in to vote, so ok,
I&#8217;ll sign in. It&#8217;s Amazon, so I should already have an account, right? Not
quite.</p>

<p>On the sign-in page, it says &#8220;Amazon Askville is an Amazon company that uses
Amazon for credential verification&#8221;, and asks for a username and password.
Looks like Amazon username and password would work, right? So I enter those,
and it just says no. Then I click the create account button, and then there&#8217;s
a link to sign in with Amazon credentials, so I enter the same Amazon username
and password again and that works.</p>

<p>So to summarize: Askville&#8217;s initial signin page implies it uses Amazon
credentials, but doesn&#8217;t, but actually does after 2 extra clicks which aren&#8217;t
particularly intuitive.</p>
