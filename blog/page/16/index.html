  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;ve noticed that a few tour bus companies in Ushuaia, running between the
town and the national park, will offer us a discount (say 55 pesos round trip
for what they say is normally 70 pesos), but then write the original full
price (70 pesos) on the receipt and ticket. Why would they do that?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m familiar with various schemes where someone charges you a high price and
then documents a lower price (maybe they pay tax on the documented price,
maybe you pay duty or tax on the documented price, maybe they&#8217;re working on a
basis where they have to give X% of the documented price to whoever owns the
taxi or bus or stand or what have you &#8211; in any of these cases, it&#8217;s to their
advantage to hide some of the money they&#8217;re making). What&#8217;s happening here is
the opposite, and I&#8217;m curious what the angle is.</p>

<p>Maybe they&#8217;re not officially allowed to compete on price &#8211; there&#8217;s a set
price for all bus companies, and nobody&#8217;s supposed to undercut it to attract
customers &#8211; but they do anyway, and don&#8217;t want written record of that?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been learning that the issues surrounding when you&#8217;re allowed and
expected to recline your airline seat are a lot more complex than I&#8217;d
previously realized.</p>

<p>First lesson was last May on a flight from Hanoi to Seoul, on Asiana (a South
Korean airline). This was a 4 hour redeye leaving at 11:20pm and arriving at
5:20am after a 2 hour time difference &#8211; so in Hanoi time it was from 11:20am
to 3:20am and in Seoul time it was from 1:20am to 5:20am &#8211; pretty well the
middle of the night by any definition.</p>

<p>As soon as we reached cruising altitude I reclined my seat and tried to sleep„
only to be awakened about 15 minutes later by a flight attendant asking me to
sit upright so she could serve the meal. Now, first of all, I wasn&#8217;t expecting
a meal on this middle-of-the-night flight and this seemed like a weird time to
eat. Second of all, on flights in the US some people sleep and others eat and
there&#8217;s no assumption that by reclining your seat you&#8217;re intruding on the
space behind you. Third, this less-than-4-hour period was the closest thing I
had to a bed that night, so I wanted to sleep; finally I&#8217;d just been woken in
the middle of the night and was cloudy-brained and peevish. I said no thanks
and tried to go back to the sleep, but the flight attendant was insistent:
&#8220;now is the time for eating.&#8221; &#8220;OK,&#8221; I replied clumsily, &#8220;but when is the time
for sleeping?&#8221; After going back and forth on this a few times, the fight
attendant said &#8220;well, if you don&#8217;t want to sit upright, that&#8217;s ok&#8221; in a voice
clearly implying it wasn&#8217;t ok, then returned to the passengers behind me and
said something in Korean which I&#8217;m sure was an apology for foreigners who
don&#8217;t know how to act. I sat there in a Walter Sobchak frame of mind (&#8220;I&#8217;m
staying here, I&#8217;m finishing my coffee&#8221;) for about 5 minutes, but confused and
feeling like a jerk and outnumbered about 300 to 1, decided finally to sit up
and read since I wasn&#8217;t going to sleep anyway.</p>

<p>Now, maybe everyone else on the flight lived in or near Seoul and was going to
go home and sleep and didn&#8217;t care about sleeping on the flight; I didn&#8217;t have
that option in my future &#8211; just a 12 hour layover that was going to be
unpleasant without sleep. But whatever. I chalked this up to strange local
customs I didn&#8217;t understand, and went on with life, until…</p>

<p>Then this week we flew from Salta (northwest Argentina) to Buenos Aires on a
flight leaving at 6:30am, also a time where I&#8217;d rather sleep than eat airline
food. Again, I reclined my seat as soon as allowed and went to sleep. This
time the flight attendant didn&#8217;t wake me, and I was asleep so I didn&#8217;t notice,
but Vanessa said the passengers behind us were complaining and getting what
looked like apologetic shrugs about clueless foreigners from the flight
attendant.</p>

<p>So &#8211; anyone else have experiences like this or know what the various customs
and expectations are around the world?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Based on our experience here in Tierra del Fuego the past few days, the name
doesn&#8217;t seem so apt; either Tierra de la Agua or Tierra del Viento would be
more descriptive.</p>

<p>The first day here we went for a hike around Glaciar Martial, lost the trail
(a story for another day), and ended up trying to cross a marshy meadow that
threatened to suck our shoes right off our feet. Or perhaps swallow us
entirely. Anyway, there&#8217;s plenty of water here, both on land (glaciers, snow,
streams, rivers, marshes) and in the ocean (the whole area is an archipelago),
so that&#8217;s why I nominate &#8220;Tierra de la Agua&#8221;.</p>

<p>Today we went on a sailboat cruise in the Beagle Channel, where we experienced
high winds &#8211; the sailboat captain said we were lucky because they can&#8217;t
always proceed on sails alone, but on the other hand, it was so windy the
entire port was closed for a while, and it was viciously cold. (Not just on
the sailboat, but everywhere we&#8217;ve been here, it&#8217;s warm if you get sun and no
wind, but quite cold if you get wind and no sun, which has been the case a
fair portion of the time.) The native Yamana people supposedly didn&#8217;t build
their own permanent shelters, but depending on the direction of the wind moved
from island to island to shelter behind rock walls that best block the current
wind &#8211; so we&#8217;re not the only ones to notice that the wind makes you cold. So
that&#8217;s why I nominate &#8220;Tierra del Viento&#8221;.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s actually from the fires that the Yamana pervasively used to keep warm &#8211;
apparently they didn&#8217;t like wearing clothes that would just get wet and
provide no protection, so they kept fires burning at all times &#8211; that Tierra
del Fuego actually gets its name. I find it a little ironic to name a
geographical area not after geographical features which are relatively
permanent, but instead after something as fleeting and transitory as fire or
the people who make it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After repeatedly saying someday I&#8217;ll start a blog and then not doing it
because of all the stuff it&#8217;s already missing and all the stuff I won&#8217;t have
time to post later, I&#8217;m just jumping in in the middle. First up I&#8217;ll be
posting a bunch of stuff from our (my and Vanessa&#8217;s) current travels, both
going forward in time and catching up from a while back, so there&#8217;ll be stuff
popping up here in an ad hoc manner, some of it backdated, and hopefully
without causing too much confusion.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oops. I just realized that the &#8220;file number reset&#8221; setting on my D90 was set
to off, because I got a new camera and assumed the default was correct,
because it is on the D700. It&#8217;s not.</p>

<p>(Background: The &#8220;file number reset&#8221; setting, when on, starts over with the
same default filename, DSC_0001, every time you use a new or erased memory
card. If you turn that setting off, the number counts up indefinitely, even
across memory cards, unless you explicitly reset it. I much prefer the no-
reset mode, so that each picture I take gets a unique filename, or at least a
filename much more likely to be unique. The D700 I use most often ships with
&#8220;off&#8221; as the default, which is good; the D90 still ships with &#8220;on&#8221; as the
default.)</p>

<p>To fix this on the D90, go to the custom setting menu, area d, and find
setting d7; turn it off.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another location where there are too many neat birds to ignore, so, more
birdwatching and another list of birds, this time from the area in and around
Ushuaia, Argentina:</p>

<p>31: Great Grebe (Macá Grande)</p>

<p>76: Rock Cormorant (Cormorán Cuello Negro)</p>

<p>78: King Cormorant (Cormorán Real)</p>

<p>118: Kelp Goose (Caranca)</p>

<p>119: Upland Goose (Cauquén Común)</p>

<p>121: Ashy-Headed Goose (Cauquén Real)</p>

<p>125: Southern Wigeon (Pato Overo)</p>

<p>138: Flying Steamer-Duck (Quetro Volador)</p>

<p>355: Austral Parakeet (Cachaño)</p>

<p>On a side note, I find the ducks and geese here a lot more interesting than
the standard-in-North-America mallard duck and Canada goose. I think that&#8217;s
not just because of novelty, but I wonder what people from outside North
America think when they first see a mallard duck or Canada goose.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my favorite things about being in Argentina is the opportunity to learn
Spanish for real &#8211; I&#8217;d taken a few months of classes and have that stilted
working knowledge which comes from classes which means that if I have time to
think very carefully I could maybe construct and understand correct sentences,
but at the speed of real conversation, all bets are off. So it was when we
arrived here; being surrounded by Spanish (or Castellano, the Argentinian
version), it&#8217;s not quite full immersion but there&#8217;s still plenty of
opportunity for learning and I can feel my brain expanding day by day. Once
you get to this point with a language, I find, it&#8217;s more important to just
keep soaking it up, forward forward forward, not bothering to backtrack when
you don&#8217;t understand every single word or concept in a conversation perfectly
&#8211; if you interrupt the flow, you&#8217;ll get that one discrete piece correct but
lose the bigger picture.</p>

<p>Many times I&#8217;ve had the sense that I understood everything in the conversation
up until 3-ish sentences ago, but have a much hazier picture of the most
recent bit. If we just keep talking, that window will revise itself as the
formerly most recent bit becomes clearer from context &#8211; so at the end of a
conversation I&#8217;ll have more than the gist of it, but if you interrupt at any
moment and ask exactly what we&#8217;re talking about I might be confused. This
occasionally leaves room for comical misunderstandings but by and large is the
most rapid way of learning I&#8217;ve found.</p>

<p>This is all by way of excusing myself for the fact that when Javier was
driving me and Vanessa up the mountain to Glaciar Martial, where we were to
hike around the ski area for a while, and he was explaining to us how we could
return to the town of Ushuaia &#8211; either along the road we&#8217;re currently driving
on, or a trail that starts alongside the road, and here&#8217;s where to find the
trail, and here&#8217;s how long to budget for it, and here are some other useful
things to know when hiking around the ski area &#8211; I didn&#8217;t understand the part
about the trail being delineated with yellow trail markers, and I didn&#8217;t let
it bother me that I didn&#8217;t understand it.</p>

<p>And <em>this</em> is all by way of excusing myself for the fact that on the way down,
we easily found the trail next to the road, then, without knowing it,
immediately lost it. We continued along a nicely cleared dirt road until it
ended in a swamp, with foot tracks going ahead through the swamp and another
well-trodden foot path to the right. Avoiding the swamp, we turned right, and
headed downhill for about 50 yards where the trail abruptly petered out.
Backtracking, we decided the trail through the swamp also looked pretty well
trafficked, so off we went, but after half an hour we hadn&#8217;t made it very far,
our feet were getting soaked, it was starting to rain, and this trail too was
disappearing.</p>

<p>At some point during all this, Vanessa &#8211; who&#8217;s more competent at Spanish
comprehension than I am, but also a lot more reluctant to admit it and act on
it &#8211; said something about following the yellow brick road, which I took as an
allusion to the fact that we were lost in Oz, but which was actually her
wondering where to find the yellow trail markers &#8211; which she had actually
understood in Javier&#8217;s instructions.</p>

<p>Eventually we gave up on the swamp trail, backtracked all the way to the paved
road, and, about 5 feet from the paved road, found the extremely-obvious-in-
retrospect yellow trail markers leading off at 90 degrees to the trail we&#8217;d
been lost on. (In our defense, they were a lot easier to see in the return
direction, and were hidden by the slope in the direction we were originally
going.)</p>

<p>Anyway. Knowing just enough to be dangerous, indeed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Disclaimer: I&#8217;m no expert birdwatcher and have heretofore exhibited little
interest in birding. However, staying for a couple days at the edge of Esteros
del Ibará, a provincial park and wildlife sanctuary in northern Argentina,
there were so many birds, and our hosts so eager about pointing them out,
there was nothing for it but to go along and get excited about birds.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a list of what we saw in 2 days here (numbers correspond to the species
listed in Aves de Argentina y Uruguay, or Birds of Argentina &amp; Uruguay, gold
edition).</p>
