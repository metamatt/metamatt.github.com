  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&rsquo;re in coastal Patagonia with the hopes of seeing penguins, dolphins, and
whales &mdash; all of which should be around this time of year. There are two big
wildlife reserves here &mdash; Peninsula Valdes to the north (known for whales and
elephant seals) and Punta Tombo to the south (the world&rsquo;s largest colonly of
Magellanic Penguins). We&rsquo;ve also been told there are good dolphin-watching
opportunities nearby, and we should try to combine this into our trip to the
penguin reserve.</p>

<p>Short story for those just interested in the animals: we saw the penguins and
dolphins and both were endearing. The dolphins we saw are Commerson&rsquo;s
dolphins, which are tiny, live here year around, and are called &ldquo;toninas&rdquo; by
the Argentinians; other larger dolphin species (&ldquo;delfines&rdquo;) show up in the
summer but aren&rsquo;t here yet. The toninas were easy to spot, and obligingly
playful, swimming near our boat, and surfing the bow waves from our and other
boats. The penguins in the Punta Tombo colony are Magellanic penguins, about 2
feet tall, fairly lazy, and fairly willing to ignore humans traipsing through
their nesting areas. We spent a few hours watching them, sleeping in their
nests, standing up and stretching and standing still for 10s of minutes at a
time, going through a wake-up grooming ritual that looks a lot like humans
brushing their teeth &mdash; hey, penguins are easy to anthropomorphize &mdash; and
occasionally waddling around.</p>

<p>Longer story with advice for anyone who might be trying this trip themselves:</p>

<p>The guidebooks we&rsquo;re using are both heavily biased towards using Puerto Madryn
as a base for visiting these areas, but we decided to stay in Trelew first,
for three reasons: it&rsquo;s closer to the penguin reserve, it&rsquo;s got the airport
we&rsquo;re flying into, and being less recommended by guidebooks it&rsquo;ll be less full
of guidebook-toting tourists.</p>

<p>So, then, here we are in Trelew trying to figure out how best to visit Punta
Tombo, but this turns out to be not incredibly obvious, either from guidebook
advice or internet searches (hmm, maybe this is why the guidebooks advise
going to Puerto Madryn).</p>

<p>It seems we have 3 basic options: a guided tour package, a taxi hired for the
day, or renting a car and going by ourselves. The taxi that picked us up from
the airport mentioned they do all-day tours to Punta Tombo for a fixed price
of AR$480, so that&rsquo;s our starting point.</p>

<p>Looking for tours, it seems like most of what&rsquo;s available starts in Puerto
Madryn and not Trelew. Using guidebook advice, we find one company starting in
Trelew but they&rsquo;re not running a tour today. Finally our hotel front desk
finds one; it&rsquo;s AR$180 per person, and visits the penguin reserve, Gaiman for
Welsh tea, and the dinosaur museum. So a group tour: nearly the same price,
takes us other places we didn&rsquo;t want to go, doesn&rsquo;t visit the dolphins, and
leaves only about 1 hour with the penguins.</p>

<p>We ruled out renting a car because I didn&rsquo;t feel like driving all day.</p>

<p>That left us back with the taxi option, and since now we know it doesn&rsquo;t cost
that much more than a package tour (for 2 people &mdash; and for 3 or 4 people, it
would actually be cheaper), plus lets us go at our own pace, stay with the
penguins as long as we want, and work the dolphins into the itinerary too,
it&rsquo;s the clear winner.</p>

<p>Next up: bus to Puerto Madryn, rent a car, and drive into Peninsula Valdes to
see the whales and elephant seals.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently by visiting now we&rsquo;re slipping in just under the window for the
legendary Argentinian beef… people are complaining already it&rsquo;s gone down in
quality and up in price just in the last year, but they expect it to keep
getting worse. The reason is a combination of the American feedlot system
taking over, and bad government subsidy policy which means there&rsquo;s no money in
beef and too much money in soy… Argentina is now actually a net <em>importer</em> of
beef now (mostly from Uruguay). And the people I talked to were not happy
about that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Argentine national parks are really expensive for foreigners. Admission tends
to be something like $75, per person, per day &mdash; unlike in the US where
national park admission is usually good for an entire vehicle for a week. (If
you aren&rsquo;t familiar with Argentine currency, here&rsquo;s a crash course: the unit
of currency is the peso, and there are currently about 4 Argentine pesos to
the US dollar. The peso symbol is the $, so to avoid confusion, I&rsquo;ll prefix
the $ symbol with the country code, either AR$ for pesos or US$ for US
dollars.)</p>

<p>Vanessa and I have visited 3 different national parks so far &ndash; Parque Nacional
Iguazu, Parque Nacional Tierra del Fuego and Parque Nacional de los Glaciares.
We visited each park for 2 days, and since there are 2 of us, and all of the
admission fees are per person per day, that means we had to buy 4 tickets &mdash;
conveniently matching the 4-to-1 ratio between pesos and dollars. Thus,
admission to Glaciares is AR$75 for a single ticket, but for the two of us to
visit on two consecutive days it cost us US$75.</p>

<p>Iguazu was also AR$75 per person per day, or US$75 for our 2-day visit, and
Tierra del Fuego was AR$65 per person per day, or US$65 for our 2-day visit.</p>

<p>Further: Argentine national parks have 3 different prices depending on where
you&rsquo;re from &mdash; residents of the same province as the park pay the least, other
Argentinians pay slightly more, and foreigners pay a lot more. That seems
somewhat fair since (a) foreigners don&rsquo;t pay taxes and (b) they mostly come
from more expensive or richer countries.</p>

<p>But, this still stings in comparison to the US: the less visited parks cost
something like US$10, and the most popular and expensive (say Yellowstone)
something like US$25. However, that gets your whole family in for a week. And
there&rsquo;s an all-access pass good for all national parks for a year (this used
to be known as the Golden Eagle pass; now it&rsquo;s called Access), which is US$80.
That&rsquo;s sounding like a better and better deal compared to Argentina, and as
far as I know it&rsquo;s available to foreigners as well.</p>

<p>(Maybe there&rsquo;s some all-access pass for Argentine parks that I don&rsquo;t know
about? As it stands, we&rsquo;ve racked up US$215 in park admission fees in just 2
weeks!)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&rsquo;re entertained by finding patterns in noise, meaning in chaos &mdash; even
false meanings &mdash; and especially if you&rsquo;re a English-speaking rap-listening
Burning Man-attending engineer &mdash; perhaps you&rsquo;ll be as amused by these
acronyms and airport codes as I am.</p>

<p>EZE &mdash; the Buenos Aires international airport, Ezeiza, practically screams
&ldquo;straight outta Compton&rdquo;.</p>

<p>BRC &mdash; the Bariloche airport, or the Black Rock City airport. (If you do a
Google search for &ldquo;BRC airport&rdquo;, both pop up in the top 3.)</p>

<p>FTE &mdash; the El Calafate airport or, if you&rsquo;ve worked in Silicon Valley and had
to read any resumes or job postings, a full-time engineer.</p>

<p>AC and DC &mdash; the equivalent of BC and AD in English, meaning Ante Cristo and
Desde Cristo. In English, we use AC and DC to refer to different kinds of
electric current, but also the rock band (whose name, judging by their
lightning-bolt logo, was inspired by electricity). But since they also have a
Genisis-inspired song (Let There Be Rock), who knows &mdash; this comes full circle
back to the Spanish Biblical meaning for AC/DC.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/reviews/2010/11/kindle-3-e-book-readers-go-mainstream.ars">Really good take on the e-book state of the union</a></p>

<p>Nate Anderson has a really good description of the current state of the e-book
world, as shown by the Kindle 3 &mdash; the device, and also the issues surrounding
whether to buy/borrow/read books on paper vs electronically.</p>

<p>He points out one subtle issue which I think is really important for the
adoption of e-books. Consider downloadable music, which really took off with
the introduction of the iPod and its &ldquo;rip, mix, burn&rdquo; mentality, showing that
you could bootstrap your new pure-electronic library by converting your
existing music library, and then go on buying music in either the old physical
format (CD) or new downloadable format. With e-books, you have to choose one,
and the choices bifurcate; as Anderson writes &ldquo;it appears that all but the
youngest of us are doomed to go through life with two different codexes,
physical and electronic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I know this matters for me &mdash; I like reading on Kindle, but often miss having
access to a book I already have on paper somewhere.</p>

<p>On the one hand, it&rsquo;s silly to use class action lawsuits as the tool to
address software bugs, but on the other hand, if Apple&rsquo;s going to publish an
update this bad and then actively prevent people from just going back to the
other version, what other recourse do upset customers have?</p>

<p>Having seen the issue firsthand &mdash; how horribly sluggish an iPhone 3G became
after upgrading from iOS 3.1 to 4.0 &mdash; I can see how people would get really
frustrated. I&rsquo;m sure Apple just saw this is a bug to fix in the next update
(iOS 4.1 is said to fix it, though I haven&rsquo;t tried it yet), but for people
whose daily-use phone was horribly sluggish for a couple months while they
waited for that upgrade, it&rsquo;s hard to excuse Apple for not letting them
downgrade back to 3.1 in the meantime.</p>
