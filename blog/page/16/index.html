  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m now traveling internationally and right before I left I got a Kindle 3 to
replace one I&rsquo;d dropped in the river. One of the unexpected benefits of the
new model is the web browser is based on WebKit and is actually functional and
useful for most sites (the browser in previous models was much more limited
and less useful, and I say this is an unexpected benefit of the new model
because for the most part, Amazon brings new software features to the old
models; I don&rsquo;t know why the new browser which is just software is only
available on the new model).</p>

<p>Another side benefit of the Kindle 3 is the built-in, free-to-use 3G wireless
access works internationally. That&rsquo;s pretty huge when you consider the hoops
and/or expenses you have to jump through to get a cell phone working with
wireless 3G data internationally. It wouldn&rsquo;t be that surprising or useful if
all the Kindle could do with 3G data is buy stuff from Amazon &mdash; which was
basically my experience with the old model &mdash; but now that the web browser is
useful, well, watch out world.</p>

<p>Anyway, so one of the things I&rsquo;ll occasionally do with this new Kindle is
check on Facebook from wherever I am that I don&rsquo;t have other internet access.
Right away, I found that the full-fledged facebook site
(<a href="http://www.facebook.com">www.facebook.com</a>) tends to crash the Kindle
browser. (So do a lot of other sites that render complicated pages. Hey, they
do call the browser an &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; feature.) That&rsquo;s annoying, so let&rsquo;s
avoid that site. Strike 1. What other options do we have?</p>

<p>Well, there&rsquo;s the old &ldquo;mobile&rdquo; facebook site (m.facebook.com), which I think
was designed for really low end browsers like mobile phones, before the iPhone
came along and redefined mobile phones as something that could maybe have a
useful browser. I tried that on my Kindle, and it loads really quickly, but
text input doesn&rsquo;t work at all, so you can&rsquo;t post status, search for friends,
or really do much of anything. Strike 2.</p>

<p>And, there&rsquo;s also the newer &ldquo;touch&rdquo; facebook site (touch.facebook.com),
intended for smarter phones (<a href="http://www.facebook.com">www.facebook.com</a>
redirects here on iPhones). This one, it turns out, works just great in the
Kindle browser.</p>

<p>So there you have it: the full-fledged site crashes, the mobile site exposes
bugs with text input, but the touch site works fine. Hopefully Amazon will fix
the other issues, but in the meantime, just use the touch site if you browse
Facebook from Kindle (I changed the bookmark for &ldquo;Facebook&rdquo; to point to
touch.facebook.com).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like that Tumblr has an app to integrate Tumblr posts into my Facebook
profile, and that it seems to work both reliably and quickly. I wish I could
say the same for the Flickr/Facebook integration (which works slowly at best,

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just started using Tumblr; here are a couple things I want to do but can&rsquo;t
figure out how.</p>

<p>1) Backdating posts. I have some things I wrote a while ago and never
published (anywhere); I&rsquo;d like to publish them here but use the date I wrote
them, not the date I publish them now. I&rsquo;d like the backdated date to be used
both for ordering posts in my blog, and shown as the date for the post. I do
see that Tumblr lets me set the date for posts, with &ldquo;publish on…&rdquo;, and if I
google for &ldquo;tumblr backdate post&rdquo; I see people discussing use of that for
backdated posts, but even if I set the date for a new post to something a
month in the past, it still shows up at the top of my blog labeled &ldquo;1 minute
ago&rdquo;. (Note this backdating behavior is the same thing you&rsquo;d want if you were
importing an existing blog from somewhere else into Tumblr.)</p>

<p>2) Reblogging stuff from my personal blog to a family blog. I see that Tumblr
lets you have multiple blogs from one account, and multiple authors for one
blog. So I set up a personal blog, and a family blog; I&rsquo;d like to repost some
but not all of my own blog posts into the family one. And I see that Tumblr
likes (and probably invented?) this concept of reblogging. So it seems I&rsquo;d
like to be able to reblog my personal posts into the family bog. However, the
&ldquo;reblog&rdquo; button doesn&rsquo;t show up on my own posts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&rsquo;ve noticed that a few tour bus companies in Ushuaia, running between the
town and the national park, will offer us a discount (say 55 pesos round trip
for what they say is normally 70 pesos), but then write the original full
price (70 pesos) on the receipt and ticket. Why would they do that?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m familiar with various schemes where someone charges you a high price and
then documents a lower price (maybe they pay tax on the documented price,
maybe you pay duty or tax on the documented price, maybe they&rsquo;re working on a
basis where they have to give X% of the documented price to whoever owns the
taxi or bus or stand or what have you &mdash; in any of these cases, it&rsquo;s to their
advantage to hide some of the money they&rsquo;re making). What&rsquo;s happening here is
the opposite, and I&rsquo;m curious what the angle is.</p>

<p>Maybe they&rsquo;re not officially allowed to compete on price &mdash; there&rsquo;s a set
price for all bus companies, and nobody&rsquo;s supposed to undercut it to attract
customers &mdash; but they do anyway, and don&rsquo;t want written record of that?</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been learning that the issues surrounding when you&rsquo;re allowed and
expected to recline your airline seat are a lot more complex than I&rsquo;d
previously realized.</p>

<p>First lesson was last May on a flight from Hanoi to Seoul, on Asiana (a South
Korean airline). This was a 4 hour redeye leaving at 11:20pm and arriving at
5:20am after a 2 hour time difference &mdash; so in Hanoi time it was from 11:20am
to 3:20am and in Seoul time it was from 1:20am to 5:20am &mdash; pretty well the
middle of the night by any definition.</p>

<p>As soon as we reached cruising altitude I reclined my seat and tried to sleep„
only to be awakened about 15 minutes later by a flight attendant asking me to
sit upright so she could serve the meal. Now, first of all, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting
a meal on this middle-of-the-night flight and this seemed like a weird time to
eat. Second of all, on flights in the US some people sleep and others eat and
there&rsquo;s no assumption that by reclining your seat you&rsquo;re intruding on the
space behind you. Third, this less-than-4-hour period was the closest thing I
had to a bed that night, so I wanted to sleep; finally I&rsquo;d just been woken in
the middle of the night and was cloudy-brained and peevish. I said no thanks
and tried to go back to the sleep, but the flight attendant was insistent:
&ldquo;now is the time for eating.&rdquo; &ldquo;OK,&rdquo; I replied clumsily, &ldquo;but when is the time
for sleeping?&rdquo; After going back and forth on this a few times, the fight
attendant said &ldquo;well, if you don&rsquo;t want to sit upright, that&rsquo;s ok&rdquo; in a voice
clearly implying it wasn&rsquo;t ok, then returned to the passengers behind me and
said something in Korean which I&rsquo;m sure was an apology for foreigners who
don&rsquo;t know how to act. I sat there in a Walter Sobchak frame of mind (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
staying here, I&rsquo;m finishing my coffee&rdquo;) for about 5 minutes, but confused and
feeling like a jerk and outnumbered about 300 to 1, decided finally to sit up
and read since I wasn&rsquo;t going to sleep anyway.</p>

<p>Now, maybe everyone else on the flight lived in or near Seoul and was going to
go home and sleep and didn&rsquo;t care about sleeping on the flight; I didn&rsquo;t have
that option in my future &mdash; just a 12 hour layover that was going to be
unpleasant without sleep. But whatever. I chalked this up to strange local
customs I didn&rsquo;t understand, and went on with life, until…</p>

<p>Then this week we flew from Salta (northwest Argentina) to Buenos Aires on a
flight leaving at 6:30am, also a time where I&rsquo;d rather sleep than eat airline
food. Again, I reclined my seat as soon as allowed and went to sleep. This
time the flight attendant didn&rsquo;t wake me, and I was asleep so I didn&rsquo;t notice,
but Vanessa said the passengers behind us were complaining and getting what
looked like apologetic shrugs about clueless foreigners from the flight
attendant.</p>

<p>So &mdash; anyone else have experiences like this or know what the various customs
and expectations are around the world?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Based on our experience here in Tierra del Fuego the past few days, the name
doesn&rsquo;t seem so apt; either Tierra de la Agua or Tierra del Viento would be
more descriptive.</p>

<p>The first day here we went for a hike around Glaciar Martial, lost the trail
(a story for another day), and ended up trying to cross a marshy meadow that
threatened to suck our shoes right off our feet. Or perhaps swallow us
entirely. Anyway, there&rsquo;s plenty of water here, both on land (glaciers, snow,
streams, rivers, marshes) and in the ocean (the whole area is an archipelago),
so that&rsquo;s why I nominate &ldquo;Tierra de la Agua&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Today we went on a sailboat cruise in the Beagle Channel, where we experienced
high winds &mdash; the sailboat captain said we were lucky because they can&rsquo;t
always proceed on sails alone, but on the other hand, it was so windy the
entire port was closed for a while, and it was viciously cold. (Not just on
the sailboat, but everywhere we&rsquo;ve been here, it&rsquo;s warm if you get sun and no
wind, but quite cold if you get wind and no sun, which has been the case a
fair portion of the time.) The native Yamana people supposedly didn&rsquo;t build
their own permanent shelters, but depending on the direction of the wind moved
from island to island to shelter behind rock walls that best block the current
wind &mdash; so we&rsquo;re not the only ones to notice that the wind makes you cold. So
that&rsquo;s why I nominate &ldquo;Tierra del Viento&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually from the fires that the Yamana pervasively used to keep warm &mdash;
apparently they didn&rsquo;t like wearing clothes that would just get wet and
provide no protection, so they kept fires burning at all times &mdash; that Tierra
del Fuego actually gets its name. I find it a little ironic to name a
geographical area not after geographical features which are relatively
permanent, but instead after something as fleeting and transitory as fire or
the people who make it.</p>

posting a bunch of stuff from our (my and Vanessa&rsquo;s) current travels, both

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oops. I just realized that the &ldquo;file number reset&rdquo; setting on my D90 was set
to off, because I got a new camera and assumed the default was correct,
because it is on the D700. It&rsquo;s not.</p>

<p>(Background: The &ldquo;file number reset&rdquo; setting, when on, starts over with the
same default filename, DSC_0001, every time you use a new or erased memory
card. If you turn that setting off, the number counts up indefinitely, even
across memory cards, unless you explicitly reset it. I much prefer the no-
reset mode, so that each picture I take gets a unique filename, or at least a
filename much more likely to be unique. The D700 I use most often ships with
&ldquo;off&rdquo; as the default, which is good; the D90 still ships with &ldquo;on&rdquo; as the
default.)</p>

<p>To fix this on the D90, go to the custom setting menu, area d, and find
setting d7; turn it off.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another location where there are too many neat birds to ignore, so, more
birdwatching and another list of birds, this time from the area in and around
Ushuaia, Argentina:</p>

<p>31: Great Grebe (Macá Grande)</p>

<p>76: Rock Cormorant (Cormorán Cuello Negro)</p>

<p>78: King Cormorant (Cormorán Real)</p>

<p>118: Kelp Goose (Caranca)</p>

<p>119: Upland Goose (Cauquén Común)</p>

<p>121: Ashy-Headed Goose (Cauquén Real)</p>

<p>125: Southern Wigeon (Pato Overo)</p>

<p>138: Flying Steamer-Duck (Quetro Volador)</p>

<p>355: Austral Parakeet (Cachaño)</p>

<p>On a side note, I find the ducks and geese here a lot more interesting than
the standard-in-North-America mallard duck and Canada goose. I think that&rsquo;s
not just because of novelty, but I wonder what people from outside North
America think when they first see a mallard duck or Canada goose.</p>
