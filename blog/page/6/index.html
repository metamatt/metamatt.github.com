  <div class="entry-content"><p>RIP Steve Jobs. Along with his passing, everyone in the tech world seems to be
telling their <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/10/the-first-time-i-used-an-%0Aapple-computer-was.ars">stories about Apple&#8217;s influence on them in their formative
years;</a> here&#8217;s mine.</p>

<p>Like Eric Bangeman in the above-linked Ars Technica article, my first computer
wasn&#8217;t an Apple II &#8211; I also had contemporary experience with TRS-80, TI
99-4/A, and Commodore 64 machines. Unlike him, my first experiences with the
Apple II didn&#8217;t stand out as more satisfying &#8211; I actually was touched more
deeply by the Commodore 64, likely because it was so much cheaper my family
could afford one much sooner. But I did spend a lot of time playing with an
Apple II+ at a friend&#8217;s house. Lots of Moon Patrol on the C64, lots of Lode
Runner on the II+, lots of BASIC programming on both… the C64 was a very
gentle introduction to these newfangled home computers, since you could plug
it into any TV, and it worked fine with no storage (games came on cartridges),
or with very cheap storage (cassette tape adapter), or you could buy a disk
drive. And the C64 had color graphics and better sound support than the
contemporary Apple II models… on the other hand, Apple&#8217;s BASIC actually had
graphics commands, which on the C64 forced you into machine language
territory.</p>

<p>Later I got an Apple IIc, and it was better in many ways than the Commodore 64
&#8211; but in other ways not much better, or no better at all, especially
considering the price. I really appreciated the democratizing influence of the
Commodore&#8217;s price &#8211; they were available for $150 at Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us, IIRC.</p>

<p>As it became time to upgrade the IIc, the original Macintosh was already on
the scene, and I had a choice &#8211; jump to Mac, or upgrade to the latest and
greatest Apple II, the IIgs. It seemed like an easy choice at the time &#8211; the
IIgs was backwards compatible with the software and peripherals I already had,
had color graphics and awesome sound, was expandable, and was roughly
equivalently powerful. Only a couple years later, Apple made it obvious they
were betting only on the Mac, finally introducing a Mac which supported color
and expandability, and essentially killed off the IIgs. (They did continue to
release impressive software updates for the IIgs, including a couple complete
rewrites of its GS/OS operating system, which I take to mean that the IIgs
software team felt much as I did about their machine&#8217;s demise.)</p>

<p>This was a real blow to me &#8211; the IIgs had been a stretch for my family to
afford, and I don&#8217;t recall any hints at the time from Apple that it would be a
dead-end purchase &#8211; so, with the wrath that only a 12 year old boy can
muster, I swore that I&#8217;d never buy another Apple product. (Only much later did
I realize that this coincided with the Steveless interregnum at Apple, opening
the door for me to reverse this pledge later.)</p>

<p>Thus was kicked off a 15 year period of PC buying, where I learned the use and
programming of MS-DOS and then Windows, from 286 to 386 to 486 and Pentium and
beyond, and again the democratizing influence of the Wintel economy was
attractive &#8211; people have long claimed that Apple computers were an overpriced
item for the snob market, and while we all know that&#8217;s not true and even the
stereotype has mostly dissolved, it&#8217;s still worth examining a little deeper.
It&#8217;s now widely accepted &#8211; and if you look closely you realize it&#8217;s been true
even longer &#8211; that Apple computers offer a good value for the money you do
spend, and compare favorably with PCs at the same price point. And yet, there
were often lower price points, satisfied only by PCs, that were still good
enough to be relevant. Probably Steve Jobs didn&#8217;t feel that way, but I know I
did, with the C64 in 1982, and with my 386 in 1992.</p>

<p>In high school, as a staffer and eventually editor of our school paper, we did
most everything on Macs &#8211; a few Mac Classics, and later one color IIci. They
were underpowered and slow, and we cursed them often, but they did the job and
most of the curses were affectionate. They also networked, which was something
PCs of the day didn&#8217;t easily do. Unlike standalone computers, networked
computers need names &#8211; I don&#8217;t remember all of them, but two of them were
Eddie Vedder and Kurt Cobain, provoking utterances like &#8220;dammit, Kurt Cobain
crashed again.&#8221;</p>

<p>In college in the later 90&#8217;s, learning about CS fundamentals and history and
non-consumer architectures and Unix and operating systems and the impact of
the MMU, it became obvious that neither Mac OS (stalled at System 7) nor
Windows (in the throes of the 9x procession) was really living up to the
promise of performance and reliability supported by the hardware that was
commonplace at this time, but that Windows 9x was closer &#8211; at least most of
the software ran preemptively scheduled separate memory spaces, and its mostly
backwards compatible cousin Windows NT could even be called a real OS. So it
was easy for me to continue looking askance at Macs (while, to be sure, my Mac
loving friends looked equally askance at Windows machines, and I&#8217;m sure we
both claimed the other crashed more). However you look at it, this was not the
proudest period for the Mac, while Apple kept trying and failing to get its
house in order with Taligent and Pink.</p>

<p>Around this time Steve Jobs returned to Apple, and kicked off efforts to
revitalize both the software and hardware behind the Mac. The hardware efforts
paid off right away, with the bondi blue iMac and later iBook; the software
efforts would take longer. I wasn&#8217;t the least bit tempted by these fruity
looking computers, running the same tired Mac OS derivatives (8 and 9 being
like Windows 98 and ME, that is, not meaningfully better than what they
succeeded), and the IIgs experience still smarted, 10 years later.</p>

<p>This remained basically true until OS X came out &#8211; a Mac OS a geek could run,
and still respect himself in the morning &#8211; and with it, the white iBook,
which both in appearance and in internals was far more respectable than its
predecessor. Just as I was graduating from college, I used my Apple student
discount and bought one, finally breaking my age-12 promise.</p>

<p>The early revs of OS X (beta, and 10.0, and 10.1) showed a lot of promise but
they were still new, under optimized and slow, and the iBook&#8217;s hardware wasn&#8217;t
enough to compensate for this, and I never ended up using it for anything
serious, deferring to more capable PC hardware I continued to buy. A year
later, I traded the iBook away as a partial payment for a Ducati motorcycle.
However, the hook was set and a couple years later, as OS X hit its stride
with 10.2 and G4 processors became affordable, that underpowered feel was
gone; I bought a G4 laptop, was won over by several factors that really matter
on laptops (suspend/resume that&#8217;s reliable, wifi that&#8217;s reliable, combining to
mean you can open the lid and be online and typing a few seconds later &#8211;
something that was a total crapshoot under Windows at the time and, um, still
mostly is another 7 years later), and, to close with another reference to
Bangeman, every computer I&#8217;ve bought since that I didn&#8217;t build myself has been
a Mac.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/07/26/nyc-marathon/">planning to run the NYC Marathon in
November</a>, as
described earlier.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also going to run the first half of the SF Marathon this coming Sunday.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in helping support my donation campaign for the NYC
Marathon, I&#8217;d like to propose a fun challenge based on how I do in the 1/2
marathon this weekend.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve run this 1/2 marathon before, 3 years ago, and finished in 1 hour 52
minutes &#8211; just a little faster than a 9-minute-per-mile pace. My training
goal for this time is an 8:00-per-mile pace (1 hour 45 minutes overall), and
my last couple training runs were at about 8:05 per mile. But I think I can do
it faster.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d be happy with an 8:00 pace &#8211; substantially faster than my current record
for this race &#8211; but even happier with 7:40 (just over 1 hour 40 minutes
total). Want to bet I can&#8217;t do it? I&#8217;ll bet I can run 7:40 miles and you bet I
can&#8217;t run faster than 8:00 miles and we&#8217;ll both donate to the MMRF based on
the difference.</p>

<p>So. If you&#8217;d like to take this challenge, and challenge me to run faster than
8:00 miles this weekend, let me know and give me a dollar amount per second.
I&#8217;ll promise to donate that amount for every second slower than 7:40 I run
(average pace), and you promise to donate that amount for every second faster
than 8:00 I run.</p>

<p>Example: you bet me $5 per second, and I finish with an average of 7:45. You
donate $75, and I donate $25. Of course, if I finish with an average of 7:55,
you donate $25 and I donate $75.</p>

<p>I chose these times because it&#8217;ll push me to run a little faster than
otherwise, and it stands a good chance of raising some money for the MMRF (as
opposed to, say, if I just bet you over/under 8:00, then there&#8217;s no
disincentive to run slower and they get less money).</p>

<p>Of course, if you&#8217;d like to make a normal less complicated donation to the
MMRF in support of my marathon bid, that&#8217;s welcome too, and <a href="http://www.active.com/donate/2011mmrfNYC/NYFULLMGinzton">my fundraising
page is here</a>.</p>

<p>But if this complicated challenge sounds fun and/or you want to make me sweat
more, please contact me (email, comments here, comments on Facebook, carrier
pigeon…) with your bet amount.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve signed up to run the New York City marathon in November. It&#8217;ll be my
first marathon, so both training and the actual event should be interesting
and challenging.</p>

<p>In addition to the personal challenge, I&#8217;m running on a team collecting
donations for the <a href="http://themmrf.org/">Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation</a>.
(Before anyone freaks out, no, I don&#8217;t have any direct connection to this
disease, neither I nor any of my immediate relatives or acquaintances. I chose
to fundraise for them because my mom and her oncologist husband say they do
good research and use their money wisely. And as my mom said, &#8220;The fight
against any kind of cancer benefits the fight against all kinds of cancer.&#8221;)</p>

<p>If you can spare $20, or more, or less, to sponsor me and support the MMRF, I,
the MMRF, and multiple myeloma patients present and future would all
appreciate it: <a href="http://www.active.com/donate/2011mmrfNYC/NYFULLMGinzton">just follow this link to my fundraising
page</a>. Thank you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My outbound Internet connection stopped working again this morning, and (like
the last couple times) evidence pointed towards my router, not the modem or
anything provided by Comcast.</p>

<p>(As I said <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/06/13/update-on-%0Acomcast-last-mile-isp-connection/">last time</a>, I&#8217;m convinced there were originally
multiple problems leading to confusion and increasing troubleshooting
difficulty, but it appears I owe Comcast at least a partial apology.)</p>

<p>The good news is there&#8217;s a software fix, which can be invoked remotely
(unfortunately not from outside the house since outbound connectivity is down,
but it does mean I don&#8217;t have to walk over to the equipment closet to power
cycle modems or routers): &#8220;mii-tool -r -R eth1&#8221; made everything happy again.</p>

<p>The router in question is a <a href="http://www.netgear.com/home/products/wirelessrouters/high-%0Aperformance/WNDR3700.aspx">Netgear
WNDR3700</a> running <a href="http://backfire.openwrt.org/10.03/README">OpenWrt 10.03
&#8220;backfire&#8221;</a>. I wonder whether this
happens to others and whether it&#8217;s a hardware or software bug. I&#8217;m hoping a
newer version of OpenWrt might fix it (but since release candidates of 10.03.1
have been appearing for 15 months now, I&#8217;m giving up hope for a new official
release; newer version probably just means trunk); alternately, it won&#8217;t be
too hard to whip up a monitoring script that tries to ping the modem and does
the mii-tool reset whenever it doesn&#8217;t see a response.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/02/15/mac-os-x-bugs-apples-%0Anever-gonna-fix/">complained</a> that Fast User Switching over a Screen Sharing connection is
a bag of hurt, and that it seems like something Apple&#8217;s never going to fix (#4
on the list at that link).</p>

<p>(Fingers crossed), maybe I was wrong: the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/features.html#screensharing">what&#8217;s-new page for
Lion</a>*
advertises per-user screen sharing, which sounds more like the Microsoft
Windows Terminal Server approach: a combination of fast user switching and
remote access, so that multiple sessions can be active simultaneously, and
remote sessions aren&#8217;t onscreen on the local console.</p>

<p>I can only hope that this new feature will make the old bug go away; I have a
hard time imagining how they&#8217;d implement detached remote sessions that still
result in the buggy behavior I described. Though, from the bug I described and
earlier incarnations that seemed related, it seems that headless isn&#8217;t a
primary/supported use case in Apple&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s hoping it gets better.</p>

<p>*: I wonder how long that URL will last; probably until the next major version is announced, since there&#8217;s no versioning in the URL. I hate linking to links that are going to break, but I don&#8217;t know of a stable equivalent.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/07/state-of-the-last-mile-%0Ainternet-connection-year-2009/">months of woe with my Comcast cable
connection</a>, and a couple months of <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/21/dsl-disappointments-too-bad-%0Athat-didnt-work/">flirtation with indie
DSL</a>, I called Comcast out for a third service visit to focus on
the external wiring. (Aside: This took some convincing from the service rep on
the phone; more on this later.)</p>

<p>I realized that our house had a bunch of old exterior cable wiring including a
dodgy splitter, left over from when we bought it, and entirely unused now.
Comcast hadn&#8217;t decided to look at this before, and it hadn&#8217;t occurred to me
that it would be related since I have no idea how things are wired downstream
of their lock box except inside my part of the house, but this time I decided
to be more careful. When the tech arrived, I asked him to open the lock box
and disconnect everything in there that I&#8217;m not using.</p>

<p>Also, the tech took a look at the wire from the pole to the lock box and said
it doesn&#8217;t meet their current standards and offered to replace it.</p>

<p>Other than some hilarity involving division of labor (one guy calls in the
order for new wiring, a separate guy shows up a day later and strings it, then
the first guy comes back a day later and actually connects it inside the lock
box, because the first guy doesn&#8217;t have the cherry picker truck to string the
cable and the second guy doesn&#8217;t have the key to the lock box?), this went
pretty smoothly.</p>

<p>So now I have shiny new wire from the pole to my house, we disconnected all
the other old wiring so from the lock box the only connected wiring is my own
new indoor wiring, and, knock on wood. one of these things was the problem and
the problem is no more.</p>

<p>(This was a month ago, and I hesitated to write about it immediately for fear
of jinxing it, but now that it&#8217;s been a month with none of the same old
problem, I&#8217;m feeling better about it.)</p>

<p>The promised aside: the service rep I spoke with on the phone was either a
genius or knew just enough about networking to be dangerous; I&#8217;m not sure
which. He asked how I knew it was Comcast&#8217;s problem and I said I&#8217;d tried
replacing the modem already so what else could it be. He said what if it&#8217;s my
router; I should try connecting my computer directly to the router and see if
the problem still happens. I explained how the problem only happens an average
of once every two weeks and there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m disconnecting all but one
computer in the house for weeks on end, and why should I suspect my router
anyway? Then we got in an argument about 192.168.100.1 and whether it is
indeed the address of the cable modem, as I believe, or, as he said, &#8220;the
address my computer uses to get online&#8221; (whatever that means). I was convinced
he was stonewalling me and he was convinced I was being difficult and this was
going nowhere so finally I said just send a tech out and he said OK but we&#8217;ll
have to charge you if it&#8217;s not our fault and I said fine, you&#8217;ve already done
that twice and I&#8217;ll just have all the charges reversed once it does turn out
to be your fault. (And I did call back later and Comcast was happy to refund
the earlier service charges once they saw they&#8217;d had 3 calls for the same
issue.)</p>

<p>So anyway. I didn&#8217;t find any of his facts or arguments highly convincing but
it did get me thinking &#8211; how do I know my router&#8217;s not acting up? It doesn&#8217;t
seem to be, but maybe. It is bleeding-edge <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a>,
after all, totally awesome in its power but not the most mainstream and tested
thing. So the next time the usual problem happened (conveniently, before the
wiring repairs mentioned above were finished), instead of power cycling the
modem I disconnected and reconnected the ethernet cable between modem and
router, thus toggling the ethernet link state. After that, connectivity was
restored &#8211; I could ping both the router and external sites &#8211; and the modem
reported no downtime.</p>

<p>That seemed like a smoking gun, but it doesn&#8217;t explain why each Comcast wiring
repair changed the frequency of the problem. At this point I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m
dealing with multiple problems, interacting or at least masking each other in
complicated ways, and making troubleshooting that much harder. It really seems
like the wiring repairs helped materially, but if I do see more &#8220;modem
crashes&#8221;, I&#8217;ll be looking hard at the router first.</p>

<p>(And to make things even more confusing, I&#8217;ll note I&#8217;ve also seen a handful of
&#8220;T4 timeout&#8221; problems where the modem complains to its logfile and then
reboots itself; that&#8217;s definitely a Comcast-side problem; it&#8217;s also wholly
distinct from the one I&#8217;ve been calling &#8220;the problem&#8221; and easily identifiable
since the modem clearly identifies it as such; it&#8217;s also a lot less annoying
because it only seems to happen in the middle of the night and it fixes itself
within minutes.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In response to my previous articles about frustrations with my DSL modem,
Sonic.net sent me a replacement modem to see if it would fare better. It had
one specific improvement but for the most part duplicated the previous
results; however I promised to post an update, and during the extra testing I
learned one more useful fact, so this is that update with that one useful
fact.</p>

<p>That useful fact: if you have two DSL lines in bonded mode, but the DSL lines
sync at different speeds, the Comtrend 5361 modem cares a lot about which
order you connect the lines (which of the fast/slow lines is master and which
is slave).</p>

<p>In more detail: the testing I was doing involved different ways of connecting
the modem to the DSL lines (one line at a time or both lines bonded, if bonded
then testing both ways to pair the incoming lines with the modem, with and
without DSL filters, with and without additional indoor wiring, and with both
Annex A and Annex M spectrum allocation modes).</p>

<p>If the modem is configured for Annex A operation and is connected to the MPOE
with no filter and minimal indoor wiring, I see it provide the good results
you&#8217;d expect: on either line alone, it transfers real bits at about 85% of
that line&#8217;s claimed sync speed, and connecting both lines together, I get the
sum of the individual speeds (or 85% of the combined sync speed, which is the
same thing), and it doesn&#8217;t matter which line is master and which line is
slave.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all as it should be. Where it gets weird is if I deviate from that
exact configuration. If I add a DSL filter, or enable Annex M, then the modem
may deliver only 1/3 of the claimed sync speed, depending on the way I connect
the 2 lines for bonded operation. Single-line operation still yields data
transfers at 85% of sync speed, and if I connect it for bonded operation with
the fast line as the master and slow line as slave I get the expected combined
rate, but if I connect the slow line as the master and the fast line as the
slave, real-world performance drops drastically. This is extra weird because
the line order doesn&#8217;t affect the sync speed; in the bad ordering, the modem
still claims a nice fast sync speed and just can&#8217;t transfer data nearly as
fast as it should. I&#8217;m still at a loss to know where the performance is going
or why.</p>

<p>Now, if you know this is a problem and know how to fix it, you can route
around it. And most people probably don&#8217;t end up with 2 DSL lines that sync at
different speeds, and I presume that if they sync at the same speed the modem
doesn&#8217;t care how you connect them. But this weird behavior sure caused me a
lot of grief and lost time.</p>

<p>On the bright side, the newer modem did perform correctly for single-line
operation on either line, which does address my initial complaint.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m giving up on DSL. There are really 3 separate reasons that it&#8217;s not
performing as I&#8217;d hoped and expected:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reliance on AT&amp;T&#8217;s wiring, and no incentives for AT&amp;T to provide good enough wiring. There&#8217;s apparently no clear agreement between Sonic.net (and more importantly their DSL equipment) and AT&amp;T as to what constitutes acceptable wiring. AT&amp;T claims they&#8217;ve met their side of the bargain, but I have one line that syncs at 18mbps and one that syncs at 3-5mbps. Clearly, there&#8217;s an important difference between them, but it&#8217;s one that AT&amp;T isn&#8217;t required to care about.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/18/dsl-disappointments-annex-m-edition/">Annex M doesn&#8217;t deliver, for me</a>. Maybe it works in other cases, but for both my fast line and slow line, it caused a significant decrease in downstream performance and no increase whatsoever in upstream performance.</li>
<li>The modem is finicky: depending on exactly how I connect it (which cabling, whether I use a filter, and what order I connect the two lines), <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/18/dsl-disappointments-misleading-sync-speed-edition/">it delivers as little as 30% of the sync speed as usable performance</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>I was hoping to see Annex A speeds syncing at the expected 40mbps down/2mbps
up, which using Annex M could be reallocated as something like 30mbps
down/5mbps up. But instead I&#8217;m getting 22mbps/2mbps from the wires in Annex A,
and Annex M reallocates that as 15mbps/2mbps, which there&#8217;s no reason to do.
The highest real transfer speeds (not sync speeds) I&#8217;ve seen, sticking with
the Annex A configuration, are 20mbps down, 1.8mbps up.</p>

<p>That 1.8mbps upstream is the clincher &#8211; that&#8217;s only a quarter of what I&#8217;m
getting from Comcast. That might be fine for people who don&#8217;t want to run
offsite backups across the WAN, but I&#8217;ve grown addicted to faster upload
speeds.</p>

<p>I really like Sonic.net as a company &#8211; their policies and their attitude
towards customers are preferable to any of the incumbents that own their own
wires. But the wiring they&#8217;re able to rent from AT&amp;T doesn&#8217;t cut it for me. If
in the future they&#8217;re able to connect my house with something better than AT&amp;T
phone wiring, I&#8217;d certainly consider it.</p>

      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two keyboard shortcuts I use very frequently under Mac OS X are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Command-H: hide the current application</li>
<li>Command-L: jump to the browser address bar (this isn&#8217;t a systemwide shortcut, but it&#8217;s the same for Safari, Chrome and Firefox, so it may as well be).</li>
</ul>


<p>These, along with Command-Tab to switch between applications, and Command-
curly brace to switch between tabs of the current application, are basically
how I navigate the system from the keyboard, and I get very annoyed when
something interferes with them and they don&#8217;t work as intended.</p>

<p>(A special note on Command-H, for hide: I&#8217;ve never liked the OS X minimize
behavior. You just get a pile of tiny icons at the end of the dock, in
addition to the app icon at the beginning of the dock. For a plethora of
reasons intertwined with the dock/taskbar/task switching behavior, minimized
windows are more useful under Windows and Linux than they are under Mac OS X.
Now, you do want a &#8220;get out of my face until I need you again&#8221; action, and
under Windows and Linux minimize is that action, but under OS X minimize is
not that action. Hide is that action.)</p>

<p>Since Command-H is bound to an important systemwide command, no apps should
override it, at least by default. It should be available for app use in
special cases (remote control or virtual machine environment where you may
need access to every possible key and there&#8217;s a predefined bypass mechanism;
kiosk apps that are designed not to be hidden), but if apps get a way to turn
this into an arms race, I wish the system gave me a way to escalate by
removing that ability from naughty ones (Adobe CreativeSuite apps are the ones
I remember being frustrating in this regard).</p>

<p>Likewise, for sites and plugins that are designed to be hosted inside a web
browser, you do realize that that browser already has dibs on certain
keystrokes, right? Again it&#8217;s Adobe that breaks conventions &#8211; Flash applets
in particular often like to hook all keystrokes, including those with meaning
to the browser like Command-L to jump to the address bar, Command-T to open a
new tab, and Command-} to go to to the next tab. Again, I&#8217;m glad this is
technically possible for those few special cases where the applet knows best,
but I can&#8217;t see a good argument for acting this way by default, and again I
wish the outer scope (in this case the browser) provided me a big hammer to
say &#8220;always interpret your own keyboard shortcuts first&#8221;.</p>

<p>This is especially annoying because not only is behavior that I depend on and
have committed to muscle memory getting blocked, but it&#8217;s not even for any
good reason &#8211; the feature that Illustrator CS3 bound to Command-H wasn&#8217;t
anything I ever used (at least it let me unmap the keyboard shortcut and
return it to the OS). And most Flash applets that steal Command-L don&#8217;t do
anything at all when I press it (nor is there, to the best of my knowledge, a
way to tell them to stop hooking keystrokes I care about, at either the Flash
Player or browser level &#8211; it&#8217;s up to the applet).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/13/dsl-%0Amodem-annoyances/">annoying behavior</a> of the Comtrend modem I got from Sonic.net: it doesn&#8217;t
always transfer real data at anywhere near the claimed &#8220;sync&#8221; speed.</p>

<p>As noted in <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/09/state-of-the-last-mile-%0Ainternet-connection-year-2011/">my initial post about Sonic.net&#8217;s Fusion
Broadband</a>, I have 2 DSL lines from Sonic.net, which each
in theory should support up to 20mbps downstream, but right now one of them
syncs at 18mbps and one of them at only 4mbps, due to overly high attenuation
in the wiring supplied by AT&amp;T. Still, I should be able to get a combined
22mbps, right?</p>

<p>Well, with the modem deployed the way I intend to use it (in a back room near
my other networking equipment and my UPS, connected to a DSL filter with a
normal telephone patch cord), according to <a href="http://speedtest.sonic.net/ookla/">Sonic&#8217;s own speed test
site</a>, I get about 4mbps download and
1.83mbps upload. Whoa, that&#8217;s a lot lower.</p>

<p>To make things weirder, if I disconnect the slow line (the one that syncs at
only 4mbps) and leave only the fast line (synced at 18mbps) connected, the
same speed test result is 15.71mbps download, 0.95mbps upload. How is one line
alone faster than the two lines together? At first I suspected a bug in the
modem when bonding lines of different speeds, but then I repeated the test at
the MPOE, and got the expected results: the two lines bonded together were
slightly faster than the fast line alone.</p>

<p>Curious, and suspicious of everything at this point, I decided to run a bunch
of tests: both at the MPOE (not depending on my own internal wiring) and in my
network closet (adding ~50 feet of internal wiring), with and without the DSL
filter supplied with the modem, and with different patch cables (the patch
cable that came with the modem, the separate Y cable Sonic gave me, and an old
patch cable I had lying around); for various combinations of each of these
variables I tested both lines together, and where possible each line alone
(that&#8217;s easy to do at the MPOE and hard to do at the server room, <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/13/dsl-modem-annoyances/">due to the
way the modem is wired for single-line
operation</a>).</p>

<p>The results are pretty weird. I&#8217;ll list the results, one per line, with a
description of the test configuration, the modem&#8217;s reported sync speed
(down/up), the actual usable speed as reported by speedtest.sonic.net, and a %
number which is the ratio of usable download speed to claimed downlink sync
speed. First, testing one line at a time:</p>

<ul>
<li>At MPOE, fast line, no filter, Y cable:  sync 18.46/1.14, speed test 15.76/0.95 (85%)</li>
<li>At network closet, fast line, with filter, Y cable: sync 18.49/1.14, speed test 15.71/0.95 (85%)</li>
<li>At MPOE, slow line, no filter, Y cable: sync 4.93/1.08, speed test 4.02/0.90 (82%)</li>
<li>At network closet, slow line, with filter, Y cable: sync 3.48/1.02, speed test won&#8217;t run (because modem has sync on slave line only)</li>
</ul>


<p>The result of these single line tests shows that my internal wiring (between
MPOE and network closet) and filter don&#8217;t seem to affect the speed at all &#8211;
the modem syncs at the same speed, and tests at the same speed, in both
locations.</p>

<p>But then, dual line tests (sorted by descending actual speed):</p>

<ul>
<li>At MPOE, both lines, no filter, Y cable: sync 23.60/2.23, speed test 20.06/1.83 (85%)</li>
<li>At MPOE, both lines, no filter, Y cable + their patch cable: sync 22.99/2.23, speed test 18.94/1.83 (82%)</li>
<li> At network closet, both lines, no filter, my patch cable: sync 22.84/2.23, speed test 12.05/1.83 (53%)</li>
<li><p>At network closet, both lines, no filter, their patch cable: sync 22.86/2.23, speed test 10.38/1.83 (45%)
At MPOE,  both lines, with filter, Y cable + their patch cable: sync
22.09/2.23, speed test 6.12/1.83 (28%)</p></li>
<li><p>At network closet, both lines, with filter, their patch cable: sync 21.83/2.23, speed test 4.23/1.83 (19%)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Note how the sync speed does not change appreciably across all these tests,
but the actual speed changes hugely. Every single difference from the minimal
MPOE configuration results in decreased speed!</p>

<p>Some additional notes: first, bonded upload speed is completely stable at
1.83mbps in every single test I&#8217;ve run. Second, I have tried various other
speed test sites, and FTP of a large test file hosted by Sonic.net in case
Flash/Java speed tests aren&#8217;t reliable indicators, but I got roughly
equivalent results from all of them, so I stick with the speedtest.sonic.net
numbers for comparison here.</p>

<p>First complaint: where are the bits going? Why is the sync speed not a
reliable indicator of real speed? It&#8217;s annoying losing speed, and it&#8217;s
annoying not being able to trust the sync speed, and this makes
troubleshooting speed problems a lot harder (it takes longer to run a speed
test than just check the sync speed, and Sonic.net&#8217;s support system shows them
my sync speed but not, I presume, my actual transfer speeds). Presumably if
the modem can&#8217;t actually transfer data at the sync rate, that&#8217;s due to errors
and dropped frames at the ATM level, but the modem&#8217;s status page shows 0 for
every ATM and DSL error category.</p>

<p>Second complaint: why do the filter, patch cable, and my internal wiring all
result in a speed loss, but only in bonded operation, and not one line at a
time, and without affecting the sync speed?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s looking increasingly unlikely that I&#8217;m going to get a fast and trouble-
free connection via DSL. I mean, I <em>could</em> put the modem by the MPOE (with no
UPS and no filter), but that wasn&#8217;t the intent, and I don&#8217;t understand why I
should have to.</p>

<p>And one final note: in response to my earlier article about this modem, Sonic
is already sending me a new one; I don&#8217;t really want to take time to repeat
all of these experiments but I&#8217;ll at least see if the new modem or new filter
does better in the cases that were worst here. (If nothing else, it should be
easier to do apples-to-apples comparisons, using the same cables and getting
all data points at both locations.)</p>
