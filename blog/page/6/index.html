  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past 5 years, I&rsquo;ve used smartphones from Apple and Palm (powered by
iOS and webOS), and played around with Android devices over the same timeframe
though I&rsquo;ve never owned one for daily use.</p>

<p>Still, I find the different design choices at the system level to be very
different, and the results pretty much what you&rsquo;d expect for each one:</p>

<ul>
<li>webOS as Palm originally shipped it: apps are written in Javascript and run in an interpreter; the platform doesn&rsquo;t swap out virtual memory. I never saw apps crash; it was pretty common to get out-of-memory errors (in the guise of a message that says you&rsquo;re trying to do too many things at once and need to close some apps). Apps were pretty slow.</li>
<li>webOS as reinterpreted by the hacker/modder community: apps are still Javascript running in an interpreter, but now there&rsquo;s a swapfile pretending there&rsquo;s more memory. (I think Palm liked this patch enough they eventually folded it back into their official kernels, actually. And if swapping caused a hit to speed, it was compensated for by the fact that the hacker kernels also overclocked the CPU.) The result with this was a platform on which apps never crashed, and also never run out of memory, but they could be glacially slow. The poster child here was the Google Maps app, which often took so long just to launch — over a minute, no kidding — that it would apparently become confused about why it had launched in the first place, and just draw a white screen. (The bit about confusion is just my narrative, but it often would draw nothing but a white screen, and that seemed to correlate highly with the times it took forever to launch.) You can certainly make the argument that an app that takes a minute to launch to a broken state is no more helpful than an app that crashed; there&rsquo;s no panacea here.</li>
<li>iOS: apps are written in Objective C and compiled to native code; there&rsquo;s no swapfile I&rsquo;m aware of. There are two results here: apps run fast, and they crash often. They crash because they segv from bad code, they crash because malloc returns null and they segv instead of checking for that, and they crash because the platform kills them for using too much memory.</li>
<li>Android: apps are written in Java and run in a JIT-compiled VM (which has gotten faster over time, notably in the 2.3 release); I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a swapfile, but I suspect stock Android releases don&rsquo;t have one and mods like CyanogenMod allow one. As I said above, I don&rsquo;t have deep experience with Android devices, but my general perception is that on contemporary roughly equivalent hardware, it feels significantly faster than webOS and significantly slower than iOS. (I&rsquo;m talking about user perception of speed here, which has to do both with how responsive the UI is and how fast real work gets done. iOS and webOS both pay more attention than Android to keeping the UI responsive, to the best of my knowledge.)</li>
</ul>


<p>So. This evidence is relatively unsurprising and easy to explain — interpreted
code that can have as much memory as it wants never crashes but takes forever
to do anything useful; native code under tight memory management is much
faster and much more crash prone — what&rsquo;s interesting to me is that all 3 of
these approaches were considered viable in the marketplace. And I don&rsquo;t even
know that the dog slowness of webOS is the reason it failed in the marketplace
(and if HP had poured the right resources into it and actually shipped what
they said they would in 2011, a better optimized webOS 3 running on 2011-class
hardware might not have even felt slow). But even discounting webOS, the other
two approaches are both provably market-viable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Santa, bless the guy, heard me getting annoyed at the sounds of hard drives
spinning up and down in the night, and decided to help me out by bringing me
SSD&rsquo;s for my and Vanessa&rsquo;s computers.</p>

<p>So, the week after Christmas, I replaced the spinning rust in my (2006) Mac
Pro and her (2009) iMac with <a href="http://amzn.to/wUySKX">Crucial M4 solid state drives</a>.</p>

<p>This was really easy in the Mac Pro; this machine is the easiest to work on
I&rsquo;ve ever owned or used, and that&rsquo;s probably why a machine from 2006 is still
ticking along so happily in 2012 &mdash; I&rsquo;ve upgraded the RAM twice, the hard
drives three times for bigger/better hard drives and twice more to supplement
and now replace them with SSDs &mdash; I don&rsquo;t really feel bottlenecked by 5-year-
old CPUs.</p>

<p>Drive upgrades are not as easy in the iMac. First of all, there are no screws
on the outside of the case; all the guts are behind the glass of the screen,
which is held on by magnets, and you need to remove it with a suction cup.
Seriously. (If you already know this, you probably don&rsquo;t find it surprising,
but when I first learned it, I was really surprised.) It&rsquo;s actually not as
hard as it sounds, but I did have to buy a suction cup. Then you have to
carefully disconnect a bunch of miniature ribbon cables. I followed the
<a href="http://www.btobey.com/learn/imac-ssd-install.php">walkthrough here</a> because
it has nice pictures, except I couldn&rsquo;t actually follow it because the 2009
iMac I was working on, unlike the more recent models, doesn&rsquo;t have a 2nd SATA
port. Which means I had to replace the hard drive, instead of adding the SSD
alongside it. That was actually the goal, since I didn&rsquo;t want to hear drives
spinning up and down, but it means I had to contend with the <a href="http://blog.macsales.com/2751-proprietary-cable-can-put-the-brakes-on-upgrading-late-09-imacs">temperature sensor issue</a>.</p>

<p>There seem to be 5 ways people deal with this:</p>

<ul>
<li>ignore it and deal with loud fans</li>
<li>use aftermarket software to control the fan speed, ignoring drive temperature</li>
<li>buy the cable from the previous generation iMac, which had the temperature sensor outside the hard drive</li>
<li>short out the temperature sensor circuit, which is apparently temperature-sensor code for &ldquo;it&rsquo;s cool&rdquo;</li>
<li>(only on newer iMacs with 2 SATA ports) leave the OEM factory hard drive attached, and add the SSD as a 2nd drive</li>
</ul>


<p>I opted for shorting the pins, as I don&rsquo;t want loud fans, don&rsquo;t really trust a
software solution, don&rsquo;t want to pay and wait for the extra part which seems
to be hard to find now anyway, and don&rsquo;t have the newer model with the 2nd
SATA port.</p>

<p>This just leaves the question of how to short the pins. Jumpers from old PC
hard drives would probably do the trick, but I don&rsquo;t have any lying around. I
could cut the cable and just short the wires, but I wanted to leave the option
to reverse this procedure if things didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>

<p>I ended up making a jumper out of a short piece of one conductor from solid-
core Category 6 network wire. Strip that, bend it in a tight U, jam it inside
the connector at the end of the sensor cable, and it fits nicely. Seems to be
working fine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2012/01/20/nothing-is-as-easy-as-it-should-be-ssd-upgrades/">the SSD upgrade project</a>, I now have a stack of unused 1TB hard drives. I also have an old NAS unit (ReadyNAS NV) which is currently hosting 4 320GB hard drives, is almost full, and while old is still compatible with the 1TB drives. Sounds like a good match — time to upgrade.</p>

<p>Reading about <a href="http://www.readynas.com/?cat=54">ReadyNAS&#8217; vaunted X-RAID technology</a>, a proprietary extension to RAID
that allows resizing, this sounds easy — one by one, replace each drive with a
larger one, and wait for the RAID to rebuild onto the new drive. When the
drives are different sizes, the array will be limited to 4x the size of the
smallest, but after upgrading all 4 to 1TB, I simply reboot and will have
access to the full new size. And since the ReadyNAS supports hot swap and has
the drives mounted in nice hot swappable sleds, I don&rsquo;t even have to reboot
except for that final resize (and I&rsquo;m not really clear on why I have to then,
but whatever).</p>

<p>Sounds easy… until I actually try swapping out the drives. The drives are in
sleds, see, and the sleds have this latch, and the latch has this release
button… and nothing happens when I press the release button. I try reading the
manual, which talks about how easy it is to add drives but doesn&rsquo;t go into any
details on what to do if you have trouble removing one. I try reading &ldquo;<a href="http://www.readynas.com/?page_id=193">The definitive guide to the ReadyNAS NV+</a>&rdquo;
(a slightly newer but very similar model) for tips; it talks about how disk
replacement eases the stress of disk failure; my mind jumps to bad puns about
stressing the ease while easing the stress, and thinking I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not
dealing with the stress of a failed disk that I can&rsquo;t remove.</p>

<p>Eventually I find a <a href="http://www.readynas.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=30550">forum thread on the problem</a>, with the
solution. It&rsquo;s 5.5 years old, and still kicking. Much like my ReadyNAS NV, I suppose.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought two <a href="http://www.nest.com/living-with-%20nest/">Nest Learning Thermostats</a> for my house, which has two furnaces. Here&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;re working out for me.</p>

<p><strong>Ordering</strong></p>

<p>I almost bought them on the day they were announced back in November, but dithered, and the initial batch sold out; I got on the waiting list and waited. In early January they sent me an email allowing me to place an order (for up to 5 units); I ordered two; they arrived Friday and I&rsquo;ve spent the weekend playing (er, working) with them.</p>

<p>One thing that happened between when I didn&rsquo;t order them the first day and when my turn to order came around was <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/12/17%20/nest-incompatibility-without-c-wire">Marco Arment&rsquo;s post on Nest incompatibility with his existing wiring</a>. Having read that, I semi-carefully checked my own wiring against Nest&rsquo;s online compatibility wizard before ordering (which I might not have bothered doing if I hadn&rsquo;t read Marco&rsquo;s post, given that my furnaces and wiring are only 3 years old, so I assumed they&rsquo;re modern). When I say &ldquo;semi-carefully&rdquo;, I mean I looked at my wires and verified them against Nest&rsquo;s tool (which says I&rsquo;m fine), and I considered Marco&rsquo;s problem (2 wires, red and white, are enough for a basic thermostat to control heating, but not to power or recharge the thermostat without activating said heating) and made sure I had a 3rd wire and figured I wouldn&rsquo;t have that problem.</p>

<p>In fact, when my thermostats arrived and I installed them, I also uttered a <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/metamatt/status/157882839508062209">triumphant but premature tweet</a> about having modern wiring. If only. If you&rsquo;re reading carefully — more carefully than I had read Marco&rsquo;s post — you&rsquo;ll note I said I had 3 wires, but not which 3 wires. And, as it turns out, I had it wrong. No, I didn&rsquo;t have a C (common) wire; my third wire was a G (fan) wire.</p>

<p><strong>Unboxing and setup</strong></p>

<p>The packaging is nice; the actual thermostat unit is nice; the base which you attach to the wall has a built-in level, and pressure-fit connectors for the wires instead of screw terminals. It&rsquo;s obvious the device was carefully designed and built without taking shortcuts — which had better be true, given the price.</p>

<p>It was fairly easy to take my old thermostat off the wall, note how it was using the wires, reconnect the same wires (Rh, W and G, again) in the same capacity to the Nest base, attach the Nest base to the wall, and then press the Nest device onto the base. It didn&rsquo;t take long to do this twice, in fact — once upstairs and once downstairs.</p>

<p>The next step is to connect the thermostat my Wi-Fi network — entering Wi-Fi passwords on small devices without keyboards is usually no fun, but entering text on the Nest&rsquo;s rotating dial is surprisingly satisfying. Kind of like using a combination lock from high school again, but less confusing. As soon as it connected to the network, the Nest found itself a software update, invoking the download-and-reboot cycle that&rsquo;s the bane of many modern smart devices. In fact, it seemed to reboot twice. The downstairs device survived this fine and next wanted me to join it to a cloud management account; the upstairs device asked me what time it was, which is a bad sign for something that&rsquo;s supposed to be connected to the internet. It turns out it had forgotten how to connect to the network, so I had to enter my Wi-Fi password again.</p>

<p>After this setup phase — which took a little longer than I&rsquo;d expected due to all that rebooting — the thermostats were active, ready to use manually, and, ostensibly, learning my habits so I don&rsquo;t need to tell them what to do.</p>

<p><strong>Use</strong></p>

<p>These thermostats are easy on the eyes and easy to use; you just turn the dial to change the temperature, or push in on the dial to bring up the onscreen UI with easy-to-understand options for setting home/away, turning the whole thing off, or invoking manual scheduling settings I haven&rsquo;t bothered playing with.</p>

<p>If you create a Nest account and install the smartphone app or use their website, you can monitor and change the temperature from anywhere, which is pretty darn space age if you ask me.</p>

<p>One minor glitch is that the just-approach-to-wake-screen feature seems to only sometimes work; the Nest is supposed to recognize when you approach and greet you by turning on the screen, but sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t turn on until I actually touch it, sometimes it only turns in when I stick my hand within inches, and sometimes it turns on when I just walk by. This would be a minor annoyance, but it also makes me wonder how well the auto-away feature will work, since that&rsquo;s also based on a proximity sensor (maybe the same one, maybe a different one, I don&rsquo;t know).</p>

<p>Two simple things my old, not-worth-blogging-about thermostat did that the Nest doesn&rsquo;t: show you the time on the main screen (my wife and I are used to using the thermostat as a clock on our way out the door, as it&rsquo;s conveniently located for that) and remind you to change the furnace filters. Oh well, not a dealbreaker, and maybe these features will appear in a future software update.</p>

<p>One design deficiency that wouldn&rsquo;t be worth complaining about with any other thermostat, but is noteworthy with the Nest now that they&rsquo;re trying to apply good design to elevate thermostats to the level of art object: off-angle viewing of the display is terrible. It looks great from straight on, but thermostats are usually mounted at chest level, not at eye level, and used from fairly close by, so in normal use I&rsquo;m looking down at the display at a fairly steep angle. Part of the problem is the LCD display itself, and part of the problem is the convex lens sitting over it; it&rsquo;s really not putting its best face forward in actual use.</p>

<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>

<p>The second day after I installed the two Nests, I heard a clicking sound coming from the heating ducts. Upon inspection, the downstairs furnace was working fine, but the upstairs furnace was making the clicking noises, which were resonating through the ducts. I fiddled with the thermostat; it wanted the furnace on but it wouldn&rsquo;t come on. I turned the thermostat off; the clicking stopped. I turned the thermostat back on, and it turned on the furnace for about a minute, then the furnace turned off and went back to clicking. I fiddled with the thermostat for a while longer, and was able to provoke various permutations of this behavior, but not a working upstairs furnace.</p>

<p>I called Nest support, and got a really helpful and knowledgeable guy who suggested I swap the upstairs and downstairs units, to help rule out a problem with the thermostat itself. After the swap, I still had problems upstairs and not downstairs — apparently the problem is with the furnace, and not the specific Nest unit. His hypothesis was that my furnace was so sensitive to voltage that it would work fine if the thermostat just bridges the Rh and W wires, but if the thermostat pulls any power at all from those wires, the furnace relays get confused and start toggling instead of staying on. Just for fun, I measured the wiring at both thermostats with a multimeter and couldn&rsquo;t detect much difference between upstairs and downstairs (in both cases, the multimeter saw 28 V across Rh and W with the thermostat detached and the furnace not running, and 0.485 A across Rh and W with the furnace running), but the Nest&rsquo;s built-in technical details monitoring report claimed voltage dropped from 29 V upstairs when not running the furnace to 7.77 V when running the furnace (and compared to 9.19 V downstairs). Is that 1.4 V difference enough to explain why one would work and the other wouldn&rsquo;t? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>When I called back to Nest support with these results, the tech support guy said this sounds like a power stealing problem and the probable solution is to run a C wire. I asked why two nearly identical (same model, different size) furnaces that are only 3 years old would be different in this regard, and he didn&rsquo;t really know.</p>

<p>Note this isn&rsquo;t the same problem Marco wrote about, though I&rsquo;d likely have that problem over time too; his problem happens if the furnace doesn&rsquo;t run very often and the Nest needs to charge itself without running the furnace; in my case the fully charged Nest couldn&rsquo;t even run the furnace when it should be on.</p>

<p><strong>Gripes</strong></p>

<p>Beyond the fact that the thermostat can&rsquo;t run one of my furnaces, it&rsquo;s annoying that the <a href="http://store.nest.com/#compatibility">Nest compatibility tool</a> doesn&rsquo;t even warn of this problem.</p>

<p>A few other things that came up with I was on the support call: first, when I was first describing the problem and giving information on how I&rsquo;d connected the Nest et cetera, I asked if they were already collecting diagnostic information in the cloud since the thermostat is smart and internet-connected, and was told no. I find that surprising and disappointing — a missed opportunity. (There&rsquo;s maybe a privacy concern, and I don&rsquo;t want them selling data on how often I run my furnace or how often I&rsquo;m home vs away, but I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t mind them collecting diagnostics to improve their product.)</p>

<p>Also while chatting with the support tech, I asked if there was a way to get the Nest to display a clock on the main screen, and to remind me when to change the furnace filter, and was told no on both accounts; then I asked if I could file a feature request for those and was told that not only do they not take feature requests from customers, but that the support techs are prohibited from talking to the product designers, both for legal/intellectual property reasons. I joked that this must be because Nest was founded by people from Apple — famous for not being persnickety about taking ideas from people who might then claim ownership of said ideas; what can you say about a company with an official &ldquo;<a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/policies/ideas.html">unsolicited idea submission policy</a>&rdquo;? — and he said yeah, if you read our privacy policy it has a lot in common with Apple&rsquo;s. But come on. It&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s any intellectual property in the idea of a thermostat displaying the time of day. And more than that: a policy that says a company can&rsquo;t listen to its customers is a customer-hostile policy.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>Basically, to get the Nest working with my upstairs furnace, I need to give it a C wire. I did consider running new thermostat control wiring, but when I looked at where the wires run, it&rsquo;s not worth the trouble — there&rsquo;s no way to rerun the wires without opening walls.</p>

<p>But. What&rsquo;s this G wire for, anyway? Following the <a href="http://%20wiki.xtronics.com/index.php/Thermostat_signals_and_wiring#Heating">Transtronics wiki</a> Marco linked to, and confirmed by observation, the thermostat doesn&rsquo;t need to tell the fan when to run while heating — I have gas heating and the furnace itself controls the fan. Now, the thermostat can also tell the fan to run without the heat, and it turns out that&rsquo;s all the G wire is good for. After checking with my wife, I confirmed we almost never use that feature (and it was relatively easy to access before, with a switch on our old thermostats, whereas with the Nest it requires digging through the settings menu a bit, so we&rsquo;re even less likely to do it).</p>

<p>Thus, the solution: repurpose the G wire as a C wire. We don&rsquo;t really need direct control over the fan, and if I do, I can run new wiring for that, to locations that aren&rsquo;t as hard to get to as the thermostat locations. (Note that this works for me because we have gas heat; electric heaters don&rsquo;t control the fan themselves, so removing the G wire would not be a good idea.) So, I had to turn off the furnace and reconnect the green wire on that end too, moving it from the G terminal to the C terminal. This quick-and-dirty solution satisfies my hacker instincts, and after a couple days of use, the Nest is much happier: the Nest&rsquo;s voltage monitoring reports 36 V at 100 mA, instead of 8 V at 20 mA without the C wire, and the furnace runs when it should.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>I like it; I&rsquo;ll keep mine.</p>

<p>But based on my experience, I can&rsquo;t recommend the Nest thermostat unless you can give it a C wire. And I&rsquo;m disappointed that all the information Nest will give you before buying doesn&rsquo;t point out even a whiff of such problems.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Nest support <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nest/status/160464579711877120">tweeted me back</a> to say they&rsquo;ve updated the compatibility tool with a note about the C wire, but in my opinion <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2012/01/20/nest-c-wire-update/">it&rsquo;s still buried where it&rsquo;s too easy to miss</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2012/01/20/nest-%20learning-thermostat-review/">Nest thermostat review</a> complained about up-front lack of obviousness about &ldquo;C&rdquo; wire compatibility issues, and Nest support <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nest/status/160464579711877120">replied with a tweet</a> saying</p>

<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ve updated the compatibility tool so there&rsquo;s a note about C wire, but you&rsquo;re right &ndash; it could be clearer.</p></blockquote>

<p>I took a trip back through the compatibility wizard, and (unless there are more changes coming) it&rsquo;s there but it&rsquo;s still not obvious.</p>

<p>First, I tell it what I&rsquo;ve got:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7001/6733277723_e2c7b691a7_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then, it tells me what to expect:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7167/6733277795_b182cdd286_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m compatible, no reservations, it says. Unless I click through the &ldquo;<a href="http://support.nest.com/customer/portal/articles/285077">Learn more</a>&rdquo; link, which from the context sounds like it&rsquo;s going to help me decide whether I can install it without help, not whether it&rsquo;s compatible with my wiring. That link goes to a &ldquo;<a href="http://support.nest.com/customer/portal/articles/285077">Does Nest need a common wire?</a>&rdquo; article, which has some useful information, including recognition of the possible problem, a suggestion to do what I did (turn another wire into a C wire if possible), and a link to <a href="http://support.nest.com/customer/portal/articles/197951-when-nest-%20needs-a-common-wire">even more details</a>.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the right information, but I wouldn&rsquo;t expect to find it hidden behind that &ldquo;Learn more&rdquo; link, and I still think anyone who clicks through the compatibility wizard without a C wire should see it. Maybe these problems are rarer than my small sample size indicates, but on the other hand, this &ldquo;power stealing&rdquo; problem doesn&rsquo;t seem like an easy one.</p>

<p>C&#8217;mon, Nest — I like the product, and now that I&rsquo;ve got mine working, I expect to remain a happy customer. But for an issue this subtle and important, I think you&rsquo;d do well to err on the side of caution.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seems like spammers are taking to spamming weblog comments wherever they are
allowed with innocuous-looking content-free posts just to link back to
themselves. (Is this somewhere between spam and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacn">bacn</a>, since it&rsquo;s not quite spam? I was
unsure at first, but now I think it&rsquo;s just spam.)</p>

<p>Typically these posts will be written in a fairly reasonable facsimile of
English, and not overtly spammy — a bunch of compliments I&rsquo;m almost
egotistical enough to believe, except there&rsquo;s no relation to the post they&rsquo;re
commenting on, and somewhere at the end, a link to some site they&rsquo;re pimping.</p>

<p>These range from the fairly obvious link</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7163/6729985265_71906afdc5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>to a link trying to masquerade as a signature</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7155/6729985235_df30215312.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>to links only in the author&rsquo;s name</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7018/6729985403_6d6804566d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>and then there&rsquo;s the variant using Tumblr&rsquo;s &ldquo;like&rdquo; feature, as in</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7003/6729985363_b922c7938a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>or</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7021/6729985315_1f0dabf0c8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>and for a final really blatant example, there&rsquo;s this guy:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7031/6729985535_44467970b4_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7024/6729985563_f4143d2412_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>These last ones might actually require more than 2 seconds of thought to
recognize as spam, if they didn&rsquo;t appear in batches of 8 on the same post.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I just delete all these, except for the Tumblr &ldquo;like&rdquo; spam
which I don&rsquo;t know how to target directly. (The next step would be turning off
both comments and Tumblr &ldquo;notes&rdquo; in the theme, which would make these problems
go away entirely.)</p>

<p>The ironic thing is these people are probably doing this for Google link
juice, but the way comments work via Disqus, it&rsquo;s all Javascript and not in
the real HTML as the page loads anyway, so I doubt indexers follow it. Plus I
just delete it anyway. Spammers, if you&rsquo;re reading this, you&rsquo;re just wasting
your time and mine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&rsquo;re a Gmail user, you&rsquo;ve already got cloud email, a contact list or
address book, and a calendar (actually a set of calendars) hosted by Google.
And if you have an iPhone, you want to connect the built-in email, contacts
and calendar applications to those Google data sources.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible, but it&rsquo;s not as easy as it should be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not easy&rdquo;, you&rsquo;re thinking? Go to Settings, &ldquo;Mail, Contacts, Calendars&rdquo;, &ldquo;Add
Account&rdquo;, and there&rsquo;s Gmail — enter your credentials, the account is set up,
what could be easier than that?</p>

<p>Well, that isn&rsquo;t hard, but it also doesn&rsquo;t work very well. If you use the
&ldquo;Gmail&rdquo; account type, it doesn&rsquo;t sync contacts at all. Email is there, via
IMAP, but Gmail via IMAP has some notable deficiencies: push email doesn&rsquo;t
work (so the iPhone doesn&rsquo;t see new mail or other changes right away), the
delete behavior is weird, and there&rsquo;s this extra &ldquo;All Mail&rdquo; folder which might
sync an extra copy of all your messages. Your calendars are there &mdash; well, by
default, only the main calendar, and not any others you may have created, or
calendars others have shared with you, or delegated/published calendars like
the one TripIt can automatically publish your travel plans to. (<a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=151674">You can fix this with an extra step</a>, after which multiple calendars work normally.)</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another way: add your Google account using the &ldquo;Microsoft Exchange&rdquo;
account type. (If this seems confusing, note that what this really means is to
access Google&rsquo;s data services using the Exchange ActiveSync, or EAS, protocol,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveSync">which Microsoft has licensed to both Apple and Google among others</a>. Even more confusing, Google
brands this method of access to its services not as Exchange or EAS, but as
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/sync/">Google Sync</a>&rdquo;. Whatever.)</p>

<p>If you do this, things get quite a bit better: contacts sync to the phone;
email gains push (and in my opinion, the folder list and delete button work
better). This is actually t<a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=138740">he method Google recommends for use with iOS</a>. Again,
only the main calendar syncs to the phone, but again, <a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=139206">there&rsquo;s a way to enable
the other calendars</a>,
which is even more of a pain than the CalDAV method.</p>

<p>(Aside: I think the ability to get multiple calendars via Google Sync and EAS
was recently added, because when I first set up my iPhone I couldn&rsquo;t find this
method, and resorted to adding my Gmail account twice: once using the
&ldquo;Exchange&rdquo; account type for email and contacts with calendars disabled, and
once using the &ldquo;Gmail&rdquo; account type for calendars with email disabled. This no
longer seems necessary, but it may be a useful tip for anyone who wants Google
contacts synced to their phone but for whatever reason don&rsquo;t like the
EAS/Google Sync behavior for email or calendars.)</p>

<p>You may also run into some problems with contact sync, documented on the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=139635">Google Sync known issues with iOS</a>&rdquo; page,
under &ldquo;Limited Contact Information&rdquo;: &ldquo;Phone number synchronization is limited
to 2 Home numbers, 1 Home Fax, 1 Mobile, 1 Pager, 3 Work (one will be labeled
&lsquo;Company Main&rsquo;) and one Work Fax number.&rdquo; Another problem <strong>not</strong> described
here is that phone numbers not exactly matching the expected labels (which are
case sensitive) will not sync: I had dozens of friends who in in my Google
contacts list had their mobile phone number labeled as &ldquo;Mobile&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;mobile&rdquo;, and these people showed up on my iPhone with no phone number at all.</p>

<p>The end result is that it&rsquo;s possible to make iOS and Google accounts play
nicely together, but it requires some up front knowledge, some extra steps in
account step on the iOS device, and some extra massaging of, potentially,
every entry in your address book to make sure the expected phone numbers sync.</p>

<p>Is it possible to do better than this? Sure. The late
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS">webOS</a> synced all my Google data (email,
calendars and contacts) easily with no extra setup beyond choosing the Gmail
account type and adding my credentials. Presumably Android is capable of
similarly smooth integration. Apple may not be interested in smoothing the
process in iOS because they&rsquo;re wary of Google&rsquo;s dominance and want to push
<a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">their own cloud data services</a>, but given the
number of people who use both Gmail and iOS, I think they do their users a
disservice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apple recently added two new features to iTunes: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/features/">iTunes in the Cloud</a>&rdquo;, which adds all your iTunes
music purchases to a cloud library which can be streamed or downloaded as
often as you want to any of your devices (iPhone, iPod, iPad, computer with
iTunes), and &ldquo;iTunes Match&rdquo;, which adds all the music you <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> buy from
iTunes to that same cloud library, enabling all the same &ldquo;iTunes in the Cloud&rdquo;
features.</p>

<p>Apple is billing this primarily as a way to get your music from your iTunes
library onto your phone or iPad without having to plan ahead and pre-sync the
music onto the device.</p>

<p>However, in addition to using iCloud to sync music between devices, iTunes
Match also has another benefit: it syncs the library metadata between multiple
iTunes libraries that enable iTunes Match using the same account.</p>

<p>This subtle addition is actually something important that I&rsquo;ve wanted from
iTunes as long as I&rsquo;ve been using it: iTunes has a bunch of organization
features including smart playlists which work best if it knows what you listen
to and how much you like it. It tracks how many times you play each song and
allows you to rate songs, and it automatically syncs this between one iTunes
library and any connected iPods, but until now each iTunes library has been an
island: if you have two computers, say a desktop and a laptop, each has its
own library, with its own play counts and ratings and playlists, and its own
idea of your preferences, and any iPods or other Apple devices you have were
able to sync songs and metadata from a single one of these libraries.</p>

<p>Now, with iTunes Match enabled, all my computers with iTunes see the same
library — all of the songs on any one of them are synced up to iCloud and then
back to the other computers, and metadata including play counts, ratings and
playlists are also kept in sync. This joining of the libraries also means it
matters a lot less which of my computers I sync a given iPod with, since
effectively they all use the same library.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s one minor remaining annoyance given the way I use iTunes at home: I
have a file server with all my music, a Mac Mini in the living room which can
play music and movies, and my main desktop computer, and each of these Macs
uses the network file server for the music files instead of storing a local
copy. (My laptop spends enough time disconnected from the home network that it
does deserve a local copy of the music.) This means that if I add music to the
library on one of the desktop computers, it&rsquo;s already accessible in the
expected location from any of the other computers that can access the file
server, though the other computers won&rsquo;t know it until I tell iTunes to add
the files to the local library. The storage is shared; the library metadata is
still per-computer. Using iTunes Match, the libraries are kept in sync
automatically, but iTunes doesn&rsquo;t notice that some of the files are magically
already local — it will show such files with the cloud icon, and offer to
stream them or download them even though that&rsquo;s unnecessary. Streaming works
fine, and downloading works, but actually downloads the file to the same
folder, notices that the file already exists, and adds a numeric suffix to
make the filename unique.</p>

<p>It would be nice if there was a way to tell iTunes to notice local copies of
files that it thinks are only in iCloud. Also, I occasionally found myself
having downloaded extra copies of songs, noticing this cluttering up the music
folder, and deleting the extra files outside of iTunes (using Finder) — this
left me in a broken state where iTunes has an entry for the song in the
library, and the file exists in the filesystem and in iCloud, but iTunes
thinks it&rsquo;s local so won&rsquo;t stream or download from iCloud and thinks it has a
different name so it won&rsquo;t play the local file, at which point things are
pretty broken. What&rsquo;s needed here is a way to stuff the file back into the
cloud, making iTunes think there is no local copy so it will go get it from
iCloud again the next time it&rsquo;s needed — I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to do this
until I read this <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/11/more-itunes-match-answers-dj-sets-how-to-replace-music-and-more.ars,">Q&amp;A article at Ars Technica</a> which has the secret: select the
song, hold the option key while pressing the delete key, and the normal delete
confirmation dialog will grow a new checkbox &ldquo;also delete this song from
iCloud&rdquo;. Leaving that option unchecked, you can delete the local copy of the
song (or, a broken link to a missing local copy of a song) while leaving it in
the cloud library, the cloud icon comes back, and iTunes will go back to
getting the data from iCloud as needed again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been wishing and waiting and watching and waiting, with an idea in my
head of what I want: from computers and the internet, regarding photos and
photo management, and connecting all the computers I use. Some of this is very
specific to photos, and some of this is general multi-computer file
management, and after years of watching and waiting, little of it is done the
way I wish it was.</p>

<p>I take photos with digital cameras. I want all of those photos accessible to
me wherever I go, on all the computers and smart devices I own and any I
happen to use temporarily; I want them backed up for safety; I want some of
them shared with my friends or the whole internet. In short: I want my
memories protected, accessible to me, and selectively shared with those I
choose to share them with.</p>

<p>There exist good file sync solutions, and there exist good backup solutions,
and there exist good photo sharing solutions, but all of them have drawbacks,
not least of which is that they&rsquo;re separate and don&rsquo;t really work together, so
I need to do more to get these combined benefits.</p>

<p>Ideally, I&rsquo;d like all photos I take immediately uploaded to a private site in
the cloud, automatically, which acts as backup and also automatically syncs
them between all my devices, and which also offers a web interface capable of
giving me full access to the collection, and selecting some photos for sharing
in a nice way, with or without authentication.</p>

<p>Since upload bandwidth is generally too slow and expensive, I want the cloud
upload to happen once, automatically and asynchronously in the background, as
soon as possible; the photo is now backed up and syncable; if I choose to
share it, there&rsquo;s no further waiting for upload.</p>

<p>I want flexible organization (which should work well with as much metadata as
I want to add, or as little), to scale to my collection of thousands of photos
over many years, and grow into the future. I want the sync solution to play
promiscuously well with other apps I choose to use, and not enforce a
particular filesystem or logical organization scheme, but I want it to offer
optional organization features which help me keep a well-groomed collection if
I can use the help. And the sync part of the solution means that any
organizational changes I make, on any connected device and in any app, is
reflected everywhere.</p>

<p>I want this to work with full-resolution photos, and raw photos, and I want it
to work with arbitrary metadata. And I want it to be promiscuously
crossplatform: on Mac and Windows and Linux desktops, and iOS and Android and
whichever other mobile platforms manage to prove their relevance.</p>

<p>I want the mobile device version to realize and revel in the constraints of
the platform, acknowledging that connectivity is ubiquitous but not always
fast or reliable, that memory is limited, and that snappy touch interactions
feel good. Thus, if I&rsquo;m using a device that combines a camera and a network
interface (any smartphone) I want every photo I take immediately sent to the
cloud for backup and syncability. I also want my entire collection synced down
to my device as a photo wallet, but, acknowledging local storage limits, I
want this to automatically downscale to an appropriate resolution, and I want
to be able to select per-device subsets of the entire collection to subscribe
to.</p>

<p>It would be great if the sync/backup/share features work with non-photo files
&mdash; the solution I envision would be file-based, and have a bunch of special
sugar for image files, but would be useful even for other files &mdash; but that&rsquo;s
not necessary. Non-photo files are already handled pretty well by services
like DropBox.</p>

<p>In fact, my continuing desire for the magic super photo cloud service is
driven by noting that by and large, photos are the only remaining file type I
have to really care about on my computer, meaning data I create that isn&rsquo;t
already well handled by cloud services. Examples that are already well
handled: Email (tons of cloud services including Gmail);  office documents
(Google Docs); unstructured notes and clippings (Evernote); miscellaneous
files that don&rsquo;t fall into the above buckets but are small (Dropbox): what&rsquo;s
left? Well, photos, music and video. But music is a special beast, which like
photos also involves largish files but unlike photos is something I buy
instead of create, meaning any individual file I want already exists in some
canonical form I can get from lots of other sources; anyway it&rsquo;s well handled:
Amazon, Apple, and Google have cloud sync; the file-based approach is somewhat
displaced by subscription services like Rhapsody and Spotify. Video is a
combination of photos and music which, in the case of video we record
ourselves, I think will end up having the same properties as photos: large
files we create, embodying our memories, that we want to sync and backup and
share. So it&rsquo;s the photos we take (and by extension I include video we take)
that we care about managing with computers, better than it&rsquo;s currently done.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a smattering of things that exist now, attacking some of the above
problems and illustrating a variety of different approaches. I&rsquo;ll call out
what they do right, and what I find lacking:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> (file sync and then some): can do most of what I&rsquo;m asking for, but it&rsquo;s not photo-specific (which could be bug or feature or both). The price is high (compared to photo sharing and backup services which usually offer unlimited storage). They have a sharing UI which has been somewhat customized for photo albums, but it&rsquo;s pretty bare bones compared to full-blown photo sharing sites. The syncing is good but not perfect; p2p sync first requires an upload to the cloud (so it makes you wait for the slow hop then skips the fast hop); it enforces a certain filesystem layout on computer clients; it doesn&rsquo;t have an appropriate mode for syncing all photos to/from smart devices at suitable resolution. All this said, Dropbox is probably the closest existing thing to what I want, and it offers good 3rd party APIs allowing others to extend it &mdash; I think they see themselves more as storage infrastructure for the web than any specific application &mdash; so if the interoperability and pricing concerns don&rsquo;t bother you, maybe it&rsquo;s already the right answer.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/features/photo-stream.html">Photo Stream</a> (photo sync): gets the sync right (the first I&rsquo;ve seen that automatically adds photos as they&rsquo;re taken). However, it has very strict and arbitrary limits: no deletion, no organization, and includes only the last 1000 photos or 30 days, so it&rsquo;s basically this write-only temporary repository that syncs across devices but which you need to manually fish the things you care about out of, and manage separately. It does have the magic auto-upload feature for network-connected cameras, and it does deal with RAW images. I see this as a promising demo of one aspect of what I&rsquo;m looking for, but it doesn&rsquo;t even touch the others (organization, backup, or sharing).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/carousel.html">Adobe Carousel</a> (photo sync and sharing): haven&rsquo;t tried it yet, and it looks promising but with limited platform support and doesn&rsquo;t handle raw files. Pricing may be a turnoff (monthly fee and limited number of carousels). Should handle sharing, both public and private. But not suitable for my entire photo library, as far as I can tell.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.crashplan.com/">CrashPlan</a> (online backup, also see Mozy, Carbonite, BackBlaze): cheap unlimited-size cloud backup, which can also let you retrieve individual files from the cloud via a web interface, which in a pinch means you can get at your files from anywhere. The web interface isn&rsquo;t optimized for this case though, nor is it optimized for photo display, and there are no suitable features for sharing (albums, delegatable access control).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> (photo sharing): Flickr is great for photo hosting and sharing; it has great organizational features and a good community. The pro version offers effectively unlimited storage and has neat tracking features so you can see the popularity of what you post. However, Flickr doesn&rsquo;t itself handle uploads or, really, client software in general, so it doesn&rsquo;t handle sync (it does have an API with good 3rd party adoption, addressing this somewhat). It doesn&rsquo;t handle RAW files, and it&rsquo;s not suitable for backup. The sharing features allow flexible public and private sharing, but with not a lot of flexibility for album display. In general, the evolution of the site has been slow since Yahoo! bought them out. I think the site was originally designed with a forward-looking vision that in the near future, nobody would need any local photo software, and you could just upload everything to Flickr, edit and organize it there, share it there, and you wouldn&rsquo;t need sync or backup. And maybe if the site had continued on its original trajectory and pace, this would have happened by now &mdash; but I find it&rsquo;s anything but true in the real world.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> (photo sharing): Facebook has huge adoption, and I&rsquo;ve found that photos I post there get seen (and &ldquo;liked&rdquo; and commented on) more than anywhere else, including Flickr. But, Facebook is a walled garden (it may be possible to use it for public photo sharing but I don&rsquo;t see people doing that in practice); content hosted there is not search engine friendly; you as the photographer also get zero control over photo presentation, zero insight into who&rsquo;s viewing your photos, and only very limited organizational features (albums with a size limit which can&rsquo;t be nested hierarchically). Person tagging and automatic face recognition make up for some of this; general ease of use and speed and reach make Facebook a good solution for sharing your photos as long as your needs are simple; however on my list of big top-level wishes (handle sync, backup, and sharing) it only touches sharing, and honestly, given the limited control over organization and presentation, I&rsquo;d prefer to use Flickr if I could get the same reach. Given the name of the site (it&rsquo;s the book of faces, after all) and the mandate implied therein, I feel like they could take this feature much much farther, but it also seems like the backup/syncing aspect I want is not part of this &ldquo;book of faces&rdquo; mandate and cries out for a dedicated solution. Note that Facebook is free and offers unlimited storage (as far as I know); the platform scales well (and is, I believe, by far the world&rsquo;s largest-volume photo server); it doesn&rsquo;t handle RAW files, or even particularly high-resolution images.</li>
<li><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/">Google&rsquo;s photo suite</a> (photo organization and sharing): Google has nice desktop client software for photo organization and editing (Picasa), which they eventually built an online companion for with sharing and automatic sync features (Picasaweb), and then integrated into their new social network, Google+. Taken together, this provides a pretty good start-to-finish solution for taking, editing, uploading, and sharing photos. However the upload/sync solution based on Picasa is not flexible or pervasive enough to serve as backup or sync files managed outside Picasa, and the website is certainly not designed to serve as a central hub for managing and syncing my entire photo library. I&rsquo;m not even sure if the sync is bidirectional; it may be upload-only.</li>
<li><a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> (generic unstructured data sync): Evernote has a good web service, with client apps and a web app for access, automatic syncing for offline access, and attractive pricing. However it doesn&rsquo;t offer any of the organization or sharing features you&rsquo;d really want for photo management, nor does it integrate with other apps via the filesystem (stuff stored in and synced via Evernote is available via the Evernote API, but not via older integration points, namely local filesystems).</li>
<li>File sync in general: Beyond Dropbox, described above, I haven&rsquo;t seen anything that really scratches this itch in the way I&rsquo;m envisioning.</li>
<li>Photo sharing in general: there are tons more photo sharing services, but by and large, they have the same properties I ascribed to Flickr above, but are less good at it. You might have a favorite that you think I&rsquo;m giving short shrift to here; fine; let me know if you know of any that are qualitatively better than Flickr on the list of things I&rsquo;m wishing for in this post.</li>
<li>Other things not mentioned here: This list is intended to show examples, not be exhaustive, so I&rsquo;ve collapsed whole categories onto one exemplar; for example, while I&rsquo;m aware of SpiderOak and see it having certain advantages over Dropbox, for my purposes here it&rsquo;s essentially the same. There are probably many other sync, backup and photo sharing services that have their own advantages but don&rsquo;t break new ground on the aspects I care about; if you know about something I missed that does address my wish list, please let me know.</li>
</ul>


<p>How I&rsquo;d build this: I&rsquo;d want the following pieces:</p>

<ol>
<li> The central cloud service which stores files securely for backup, and handles sync to any clients I&rsquo;ve authorized.</li>
<li> Client software for every platform which matters, which handles sync, automatically in the background: new files appearing first on this device are uploaded to the cloud service; new files announced from the cloud service are synced (at an appropriate resolution) down to this device&rsquo;s local library; changes to existing files (including filesystem metadata like name and location, picture-specific metadata like that encoded in EXIF and IPTC mechanisms, and image data itself) are also automatically synced in both directions.</li>
<li> Web app atop the first cloud service which handles organization and management &mdash; letting me move files between folders or albums, apply tags, and designate what to share with whom.</li>
<li> Web app for sharing, pulling authorized files from the cloud service, and displaying them with nice presentation and according to whatever organization (individual file, album, by tag, etc) I&rsquo;ve chosen.</li>
<li> Client local versions of #3 (optional and lower priority, since I should be able to use the web version or any local software I want to most things this could do).</li>
</ol>


<p>(I think Evernote, top to bottom, service to applications, is a great example
of this architecture &mdash; handling what they call &ldquo;notes&rdquo;, which basically means
document snippets with attachments &mdash; but, as described above, it doesn&rsquo;t
solve my photo sync problem, since the client local apps don&rsquo;t integrate my
local filesystem and provide an integration point for other local apps, and
the web interface doesn&rsquo;t have theorganization and display features I&rsquo;d want
for photos.)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what this should cost or what I&rsquo;d be willing to pay for it &mdash;
more than free (Google and Facebook); probably more than Flickr&rsquo;s $25/year and
more than the unlimited backup companies&#8217; $5/month; probably less than
Dropbox&rsquo;s per-GB-per-month fees. For this to be done right, the storage and
bandwidth would probably have significant cost, and most of the data is
private so can&rsquo;t be de-duped.</p>

<p>Clearly this isn&rsquo;t easy &mdash; the inherent challenges of handling and
transporting and scaling to this much data, and designing good interfaces for
all the services and applications, are real, and for anyone but the
incumbents, there are also the additional challenges of integrating with 3rd
party software and OS platforms, especially less open and less flexible mobile
platforms (given the sandboxing and multitasking restrictions in iOS, for
example, I&rsquo;m not sure anyone but Apple is in a position to implement Photo
Stream for iOS right now).</p>

<p>But it would be nice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My first impressions after playing with the Kindle Fire for an hour or so:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>it&rsquo;s basically a color, video-happy, app-happy Kindle.</p></li>
<li><p>fine for reading Kindle books, but if that&rsquo;s what you want to do, the e-ink Kindles are cheaper, lighter, less distracting, and have much better battery life.</p></li>
<li><p>video playback from Amazon&rsquo;s store or Netflix works great</p></li>
<li><p>app selection is small, but I&rsquo;ll bet a lot of games show up soon/over time</p></li>
<li><p>overall touch interaction is ok but clunky, doesn&rsquo;t quite feel right compared to iOS, scrolling is choppy, some touches aren&rsquo;t recognized, some light touches send it scrolling for miles</p></li>
<li><p>web browser feels decidedly not as fast as this year&rsquo;s Apple devices (iPad 2, iPhone 4S). So much for Silk?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, if you compare it head to head against an iPad 2, of course the iPad
comes out ahead, but it also costs 2.5x more, and is bigger and heavier. But
iOS still sets the standard for natural touch interaction, and iOS also has a
much wider app selection. Plus there&rsquo;s more hardware packed into an iPad:
camera and GPS, and options for adding external keyboards, so some people even
find they can use it as a laptop replacement… anyway, I don&rsquo;t see the Kindle
Fire having comparable versatility.</p>

<p>If you want to focus on reading, video and games, and you like the 7&#8221; size
(which is just right in many ways), the Kindle Fire is pretty compelling,
especially given the price.</p>

<p>I sure hope Amazon is rapidly improving the touch interaction via software
updates, though.</p>
