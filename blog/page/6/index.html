  <div class="entry-content"><p>My first impressions after playing with the Kindle Fire for an hour or so:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>it&rsquo;s basically a color, video-happy, app-happy Kindle.</p></li>
<li><p>fine for reading Kindle books, but if that&rsquo;s what you want to do, the e-ink Kindles are cheaper, lighter, less distracting, and have much better battery life.</p></li>
<li><p>video playback from Amazon&rsquo;s store or Netflix works great</p></li>
<li><p>app selection is small, but I&rsquo;ll bet a lot of games show up soon/over time</p></li>
<li><p>overall touch interaction is ok but clunky, doesn&rsquo;t quite feel right compared to iOS, scrolling is choppy, some touches aren&rsquo;t recognized, some light touches send it scrolling for miles</p></li>
<li><p>web browser feels decidedly not as fast as this year&rsquo;s Apple devices (iPad 2, iPhone 4S). So much for Silk?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, if you compare it head to head against an iPad 2, of course the iPad
comes out ahead, but it also costs 2.5x more, and is bigger and heavier. But
iOS still sets the standard for natural touch interaction, and iOS also has a
much wider app selection. Plus there&rsquo;s more hardware packed into an iPad:
camera and GPS, and options for adding external keyboards, so some people even
find they can use it as a laptop replacement… anyway, I don&rsquo;t see the Kindle
Fire having comparable versatility.</p>

<p>If you want to focus on reading, video and games, and you like the 7&#8221; size
(which is just right in many ways), the Kindle Fire is pretty compelling,
especially given the price.</p>

<p>I sure hope Amazon is rapidly improving the touch interaction via software
updates, though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wrote a <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/11/17/kindle-fire-first-impressions/">semi-positive mini-review of the Kindle
Fire</a>
this morning.</p>

<p>Then I read <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/11/17/kindle-fire-review">Marco Arment&rsquo;s rather scathing &ldquo;human
review&rdquo;</a>, and wondered:
wait a minute, if it&rsquo;s that bad, should I return it, and wait for a better
version (or save my money if no better version materializes)?</p>

<p>The thing is, I saw most of the same things he did and had most of the same
complaints; I just expect Amazon to fix them. Marco sees the glass half-empty;
I see it half-full; maybe I&rsquo;m too much of an optimist. I understand that it&rsquo;s
smarter to buy something for or judge something on its current capabilities,
not ones that may or may not materialize in the future. Still, it seems worth
considering how much better the current generation hardware might be able to
get with software updates.</p>

<p>Most of the complaints centered around speed and touch interaction. And those
are legitimate &mdash; lots of taps are ignored; lots of taps are interpreted as
small drags from nowhere to nowhere; scrolling is chunky and jerky; it&rsquo;s at
best annoying and far from a premium experience. For goodness sake, the orange
pointed stripe that you drag to unlock the device, every time you want to wake
it from sleep, doesn&rsquo;t drag smoothly &mdash; it&rsquo;s the first thing you see; how hard
is it to get that right? Still, if Amazon cares &mdash; and I hope they do &mdash; they
should be able to fix this.</p>

<p>So will they (fix it)? What&rsquo;s the problem here, anyway? <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5117/amazon-kindle-fire-tore-%0Adown-has-512mb-of-ram">The hardware should
be up to the task</a> &mdash;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_OMAP#OMAP_4"> TI OMAP 4430
SOC</a> with two
gigahertz CPU cores on Cortex A9 architecture and PowerVR SGX540 GPU, 512MB of
RAM. That compares favorably with this year&rsquo;s Apple devices based on the A5
SOC (iPad 2, iPhone 4S: two comparable CPU cores and a somewhat newer GPU
core) and very favorably with last year&rsquo;s Apple devices based on the A4 SOC
(iPhone 4 and 4th-generation iPod Touch: one comparable CPU core and a
somewhat older GPU core). I heard that <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/14/siegler-specs">specs are
dead</a>, but at least
this establishes a baseline. And note that at the Kindle Fire&rsquo;s 1024x600
screen resolution, it&rsquo;s pushing the exact same number of pixels as the 960x640
retina display in the iPhone 4 and 4S. So assuming they can figure out how to
effectively leverage the CPUs and GPU &mdash; I don&rsquo;t know how good Android is at
this, and I don&rsquo;t know what shortcuts Amazon took in forking Android, and so
on &mdash; you&rsquo;d think they should be able to get iPhone 4S-like performance out of
this. At the very least they should be able to compete with the 4th-generation
iPod Touch (which is a year old and the same price). The point is that Amazon
and Apple (and everyone else too) are using similar guts, with similar-
architecture ARM CPU cores and PowerVR GPU cores. Right now, the iPod Touch is
night and day more responsive. Amazon, get cracking.</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;ve owned the previous 2 generations of e-ink Kindle and Amazon delivered
significant software updates to these long after purchase; that gives me
reason to be hopeful the same applies to the Kindle Fire.)</p>

<p>Some of the complaints were about missing physical buttons &mdash; hardware volume
buttons would be nice, a dedicated home button would be nice, and there&rsquo;s no
way to fix those problems in software. (The headphone complaints are also
legitimate; the headphone jack location is obviously not patchable in
software; the popping might be; however I don&rsquo;t really care, because the iPod
has so won the music race that I don&rsquo;t have any desire to use the Kindle Fire
for music. I do find it notable that pretty much every non-Apple multifunction
device that <em>can</em> play music takes it so unseriously that they have popping
problems like this; that&rsquo;s par for the course with old and new Palm
smartphones too… oh well.)</p>

<p>What this boils down to is this: if Amazon can wring decent performance out of
the hardware, and pay some real attention to nitpicky details about the touch
interaction, about half of Marco&rsquo;s (and my) complaints should go away. I see
no reason this is impossible to fix with the current hardware. However, if
they also decide to yield to common sense and add hardware home and volume
buttons, the first-generation units will forever feel lacking by comparison.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll close with a final note on why I&rsquo;m willing to give the Kindle Fire some
slack. I&rsquo;m not trying to compare the Kindle Fire and iPad or argue the Kindle
Fire kills or replaces anything else, much less the iPad. But I do think the
Kindle Fire has the right guts to deliver a much better experience than it
does today, and is fixable in software if Amazon has the will to improve it.
I&rsquo;m also intrigued that there&rsquo;s finally an Android competitor to the iPod
Touch &mdash; decent hardware sold contract-free and unsubsidized for an honest
$200. (Incidentally, that&rsquo;s something <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/apples_pricing_advantage">John Gruber called out for
before</a>.) The big
difference between the Kindle Fire and the iPod Touch, other than the
operating system (and the responsiveness and app ecosystem that put Apple way
ahead on the software side) is obviously the size; I&rsquo;m not going to get into
the screen size argument, other than to point out that anything that doesn&rsquo;t
fit in a pocket is clearly less portable than anything that does, and that
size imposes so many tradeoffs there&rsquo;s no one perfect size. Pick the one that
works for you.</p>

<p>Given that the $200 Android-based iPod Touch competitor now exists, I&rsquo;m
interested to see what happens with the app ecosystem. I think it could be a
big gaming success, the way the iPod Touch has been, for example.</p>

<p>If Amazon can endow it with a major dose of missing snappiness, that is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the MMRF: They raised about $525K via this marathon, which is one third of
their overall events-based fundraising for the year. (And this year was a
record high.) $4300 of that was from you all, so one more big thank-you from
me, the MMRF, and the people they try to help.</p>

<p>For the marathon as a whole: Conditions were great, and the top 3 men all beat
the previous course record. You can find plenty of news stories on this if
you&rsquo;re curious.</p>

<p>For me: I originally started training for this marathon (my first) with a goal
of finishing in under 4 hours, which is about 9 minutes per mile. Towards the
middle of my training, it became obvious that I&rsquo;d be able to exceed that goal
and revised it to somewhere between a very optimistic 8 minutes per mile (3:30
total) to a more realistic 8:30 per mile (3:45 total). I ran with my friend
Jeff pacing me (he&rsquo;s run a couple marathons before) and we set out with a goal
of starting with 8:30 miles and speeding up as we went.</p>

<p>Of course, at the beginning we felt great and it was hard to run the exact
speed we&rsquo;d planned. We did the first 6 miles a little slower than 8 minutes,
then still felt strong so we sped up a little. Up through the first 16 miles
(which is right where the course enters Manhattan for the first time) I felt
great. At 16 miles I began to feel only good, but we kept the pace around 8
minutes per mile until mile 22, where a couple things happened: I began to
feel not great at all, there&rsquo;s a very mild but very long uphill leading into
Central Park, and I decided I needed to slow down. Jeff stayed strong and went
on ahead; I slowed down by about a minute a mile, did the last 4 miles at
about a 9:30 pace, and finished in 3:37:19. (Jeff finished in 3:32:35, and I
say thanks to Jeff for pulling me along at a strong pace and congrats for
being able to stick it out the whole way.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because during the first 16 miles I felt like I should go do this
every day, and during the last 4 miles I never wanted to do it again, and
after finishing, of course, my feelings (a little more detached and not in the
middle of a runner&rsquo;s high or extreme pain) are somewhere in between. During
those last 4 miles, I knew I had to just keep slogging on to the finish; I
couldn&rsquo;t quite keep the 8 minute pace but I knew I had to keep running;
slowing down any more wouldn&rsquo;t have felt better; the only thing that would
have felt good at that point was quitting, and I knew that wasn&rsquo;t an option,
not least because of yall&rsquo;s support.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m very happy with the result for my first marathon, and looking
back, I don&rsquo;t know if the pain and the subsequent slowdown in the last 4 miles
is (a) because we went out too fast, (b) because I didn&rsquo;t do quite enough
training at a >20 mile distance, &copy; lack of fuel, or (d) totally normal and
that&rsquo;s why they call it a marathon.</p>

<p>I also have to praise the marathon organizers &mdash; this race had the best
organization (website, runner tracking, getting to the start line, knowing
what to expect), the best infrastructure (timing mats almost every mile,
drinks and food along the way), and the best cheering crowd of any race I&rsquo;ve
ever been involved in. That&rsquo;s what I was told to expect ahead of time, but it
sure lived up to expectations. If you&rsquo;ve run NYC before you know what I&rsquo;m
talking about, and if you haven&rsquo;t and you&rsquo;re a runner, do consider it. It
really was a great experience.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re curious for any more details, the marathon website has the detailed
splits available &mdash; go to <a href="http://trackmyrun%0Aners.ingnycmarathon.org/Runners.aspx">[http://trackmyrunners.ingnycmarathon.org/Runners.a
spx](http://trackmyrunners.ingnycmarathon.org/Runners.aspx)</a> and search for Ginzton. Then click the +
button on the far right, and it&rsquo;ll turn my name into a link which you can
click on for the details.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>RIP Steve Jobs. Along with his passing, everyone in the tech world seems to be
telling their <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/10/the-first-time-i-used-an-%0Aapple-computer-was.ars">stories about Apple&rsquo;s influence on them in their formative
years;</a> here&rsquo;s mine.</p>

<p>Like Eric Bangeman in the above-linked Ars Technica article, my first computer
wasn&rsquo;t an Apple II &mdash; I also had contemporary experience with TRS-80, TI
99-4/A, and Commodore 64 machines. Unlike him, my first experiences with the
Apple II didn&rsquo;t stand out as more satisfying &mdash; I actually was touched more
deeply by the Commodore 64, likely because it was so much cheaper my family
could afford one much sooner. But I did spend a lot of time playing with an
Apple II+ at a friend&rsquo;s house. Lots of Moon Patrol on the C64, lots of Lode
Runner on the II+, lots of BASIC programming on both… the C64 was a very
gentle introduction to these newfangled home computers, since you could plug
it into any TV, and it worked fine with no storage (games came on cartridges),
or with very cheap storage (cassette tape adapter), or you could buy a disk
drive. And the C64 had color graphics and better sound support than the
contemporary Apple II models… on the other hand, Apple&rsquo;s BASIC actually had
graphics commands, which on the C64 forced you into machine language
territory.</p>

<p>Later I got an Apple IIc, and it was better in many ways than the Commodore 64
&mdash; but in other ways not much better, or no better at all, especially
considering the price. I really appreciated the democratizing influence of the
Commodore&rsquo;s price &mdash; they were available for $150 at Toys &lsquo;R&rsquo; Us, IIRC.</p>

<p>As it became time to upgrade the IIc, the original Macintosh was already on
the scene, and I had a choice &mdash; jump to Mac, or upgrade to the latest and
greatest Apple II, the IIgs. It seemed like an easy choice at the time &mdash; the
IIgs was backwards compatible with the software and peripherals I already had,
had color graphics and awesome sound, was expandable, and was roughly
equivalently powerful. Only a couple years later, Apple made it obvious they
were betting only on the Mac, finally introducing a Mac which supported color
and expandability, and essentially killed off the IIgs. (They did continue to
release impressive software updates for the IIgs, including a couple complete
rewrites of its GS/OS operating system, which I take to mean that the IIgs
software team felt much as I did about their machine&rsquo;s demise.)</p>

<p>This was a real blow to me &mdash; the IIgs had been a stretch for my family to
afford, and I don&rsquo;t recall any hints at the time from Apple that it would be a
dead-end purchase &mdash; so, with the wrath that only a 12 year old boy can
muster, I swore that I&rsquo;d never buy another Apple product. (Only much later did
I realize that this coincided with the Steveless interregnum at Apple, opening
the door for me to reverse this pledge later.)</p>

<p>Thus was kicked off a 15 year period of PC buying, where I learned the use and
programming of MS-DOS and then Windows, from 286 to 386 to 486 and Pentium and
beyond, and again the democratizing influence of the Wintel economy was
attractive &mdash; people have long claimed that Apple computers were an overpriced
item for the snob market, and while we all know that&rsquo;s not true and even the
stereotype has mostly dissolved, it&rsquo;s still worth examining a little deeper.
It&rsquo;s now widely accepted &mdash; and if you look closely you realize it&rsquo;s been true
even longer &mdash; that Apple computers offer a good value for the money you do
spend, and compare favorably with PCs at the same price point. And yet, there
were often lower price points, satisfied only by PCs, that were still good
enough to be relevant. Probably Steve Jobs didn&rsquo;t feel that way, but I know I
did, with the C64 in 1982, and with my 386 in 1992.</p>

<p>In high school, as a staffer and eventually editor of our school paper, we did
most everything on Macs &mdash; a few Mac Classics, and later one color IIci. They
were underpowered and slow, and we cursed them often, but they did the job and
most of the curses were affectionate. They also networked, which was something
PCs of the day didn&rsquo;t easily do. Unlike standalone computers, networked
computers need names &mdash; I don&rsquo;t remember all of them, but two of them were
Eddie Vedder and Kurt Cobain, provoking utterances like &ldquo;dammit, Kurt Cobain
crashed again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In college in the later 90&rsquo;s, learning about CS fundamentals and history and
non-consumer architectures and Unix and operating systems and the impact of
the MMU, it became obvious that neither Mac OS (stalled at System 7) nor
Windows (in the throes of the 9x procession) was really living up to the
promise of performance and reliability supported by the hardware that was
commonplace at this time, but that Windows 9x was closer &mdash; at least most of
the software ran preemptively scheduled separate memory spaces, and its mostly
backwards compatible cousin Windows NT could even be called a real OS. So it
was easy for me to continue looking askance at Macs (while, to be sure, my Mac
loving friends looked equally askance at Windows machines, and I&rsquo;m sure we
both claimed the other crashed more). However you look at it, this was not the
proudest period for the Mac, while Apple kept trying and failing to get its
house in order with Taligent and Pink.</p>

<p>Around this time Steve Jobs returned to Apple, and kicked off efforts to
revitalize both the software and hardware behind the Mac. The hardware efforts
paid off right away, with the bondi blue iMac and later iBook; the software
efforts would take longer. I wasn&rsquo;t the least bit tempted by these fruity
looking computers, running the same tired Mac OS derivatives (8 and 9 being
like Windows 98 and ME, that is, not meaningfully better than what they
succeeded), and the IIgs experience still smarted, 10 years later.</p>

<p>This remained basically true until OS X came out &mdash; a Mac OS a geek could run,
and still respect himself in the morning &mdash; and with it, the white iBook,
which both in appearance and in internals was far more respectable than its
predecessor. Just as I was graduating from college, I used my Apple student
discount and bought one, finally breaking my age-12 promise.</p>

<p>The early revs of OS X (beta, and 10.0, and 10.1) showed a lot of promise but
they were still new, under optimized and slow, and the iBook&rsquo;s hardware wasn&rsquo;t
enough to compensate for this, and I never ended up using it for anything
serious, deferring to more capable PC hardware I continued to buy. A year
later, I traded the iBook away as a partial payment for a Ducati motorcycle.
However, the hook was set and a couple years later, as OS X hit its stride
with 10.2 and G4 processors became affordable, that underpowered feel was
gone; I bought a G4 laptop, was won over by several factors that really matter
on laptops (suspend/resume that&rsquo;s reliable, wifi that&rsquo;s reliable, combining to
mean you can open the lid and be online and typing a few seconds later &mdash;
something that was a total crapshoot under Windows at the time and, um, still
mostly is another 7 years later), and, to close with another reference to
Bangeman, every computer I&rsquo;ve bought since that I didn&rsquo;t build myself has been
a Mac.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/07/26/nyc-marathon/">planning to run the NYC Marathon in
November</a>, as
described earlier.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also going to run the first half of the SF Marathon this coming Sunday.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in helping support my donation campaign for the NYC
Marathon, I&rsquo;d like to propose a fun challenge based on how I do in the &frac12;
marathon this weekend.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve run this &frac12; marathon before, 3 years ago, and finished in 1 hour 52
minutes &mdash; just a little faster than a 9-minute-per-mile pace. My training
goal for this time is an 8:00-per-mile pace (1 hour 45 minutes overall), and
my last couple training runs were at about 8:05 per mile. But I think I can do
it faster.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be happy with an 8:00 pace &mdash; substantially faster than my current record
for this race &mdash; but even happier with 7:40 (just over 1 hour 40 minutes
total). Want to bet I can&rsquo;t do it? I&rsquo;ll bet I can run 7:40 miles and you bet I
can&rsquo;t run faster than 8:00 miles and we&rsquo;ll both donate to the MMRF based on
the difference.</p>

<p>So. If you&rsquo;d like to take this challenge, and challenge me to run faster than
8:00 miles this weekend, let me know and give me a dollar amount per second.
I&rsquo;ll promise to donate that amount for every second slower than 7:40 I run
(average pace), and you promise to donate that amount for every second faster
than 8:00 I run.</p>

<p>Example: you bet me $5 per second, and I finish with an average of 7:45. You
donate $75, and I donate $25. Of course, if I finish with an average of 7:55,
you donate $25 and I donate $75.</p>

<p>I chose these times because it&rsquo;ll push me to run a little faster than
otherwise, and it stands a good chance of raising some money for the MMRF (as
opposed to, say, if I just bet you over/under 8:00, then there&rsquo;s no
disincentive to run slower and they get less money).</p>

<p>Of course, if you&rsquo;d like to make a normal less complicated donation to the
MMRF in support of my marathon bid, that&rsquo;s welcome too, and <a href="http://www.active.com/donate/2011mmrfNYC/NYFULLMGinzton">my fundraising
page is here</a>.</p>

<p>But if this complicated challenge sounds fun and/or you want to make me sweat
more, please contact me (email, comments here, comments on Facebook, carrier
pigeon…) with your bet amount.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve signed up to run the New York City marathon in November. It&rsquo;ll be my
first marathon, so both training and the actual event should be interesting
and challenging.</p>

<p>In addition to the personal challenge, I&rsquo;m running on a team collecting
donations for the <a href="http://themmrf.org/">Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation</a>.
(Before anyone freaks out, no, I don&rsquo;t have any direct connection to this
disease, neither I nor any of my immediate relatives or acquaintances. I chose
to fundraise for them because my mom and her oncologist husband say they do
good research and use their money wisely. And as my mom said, &ldquo;The fight
against any kind of cancer benefits the fight against all kinds of cancer.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>If you can spare $20, or more, or less, to sponsor me and support the MMRF, I,
the MMRF, and multiple myeloma patients present and future would all
appreciate it: <a href="http://www.active.com/donate/2011mmrfNYC/NYFULLMGinzton">just follow this link to my fundraising
page</a>. Thank you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My outbound Internet connection stopped working again this morning, and (like
the last couple times) evidence pointed towards my router, not the modem or
anything provided by Comcast.</p>

<p>(As I said <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/06/13/update-on-%0Acomcast-last-mile-isp-connection/">last time</a>, I&rsquo;m convinced there were originally
multiple problems leading to confusion and increasing troubleshooting
difficulty, but it appears I owe Comcast at least a partial apology.)</p>

<p>The good news is there&rsquo;s a software fix, which can be invoked remotely
(unfortunately not from outside the house since outbound connectivity is down,
but it does mean I don&rsquo;t have to walk over to the equipment closet to power
cycle modems or routers): &ldquo;mii-tool -r -R eth1&rdquo; made everything happy again.</p>

<p>The router in question is a <a href="http://www.netgear.com/home/products/wirelessrouters/high-%0Aperformance/WNDR3700.aspx">Netgear
WNDR3700</a> running <a href="http://backfire.openwrt.org/10.03/README">OpenWrt 10.03
&ldquo;backfire&rdquo;</a>. I wonder whether this
happens to others and whether it&rsquo;s a hardware or software bug. I&rsquo;m hoping a
newer version of OpenWrt might fix it (but since release candidates of 10.03.1
have been appearing for 15 months now, I&rsquo;m giving up hope for a new official
release; newer version probably just means trunk); alternately, it won&rsquo;t be
too hard to whip up a monitoring script that tries to ping the modem and does
the mii-tool reset whenever it doesn&rsquo;t see a response.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/02/15/mac-os-x-bugs-apples-%0Anever-gonna-fix/">complained</a> that Fast User Switching over a Screen Sharing connection is
a bag of hurt, and that it seems like something Apple&rsquo;s never going to fix (#4
on the list at that link).</p>

<p>(Fingers crossed), maybe I was wrong: the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/features.html#screensharing">what&rsquo;s-new page for
Lion</a>*
advertises per-user screen sharing, which sounds more like the Microsoft
Windows Terminal Server approach: a combination of fast user switching and
remote access, so that multiple sessions can be active simultaneously, and
remote sessions aren&rsquo;t onscreen on the local console.</p>

<p>I can only hope that this new feature will make the old bug go away; I have a
hard time imagining how they&rsquo;d implement detached remote sessions that still
result in the buggy behavior I described. Though, from the bug I described and
earlier incarnations that seemed related, it seems that headless isn&rsquo;t a
primary/supported use case in Apple&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping it gets better.</p>

<p>*: I wonder how long that URL will last; probably until the next major version is announced, since there&rsquo;s no versioning in the URL. I hate linking to links that are going to break, but I don&rsquo;t know of a stable equivalent.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/07/state-of-the-last-mile-%0Ainternet-connection-year-2009/">months of woe with my Comcast cable
connection</a>, and a couple months of <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/21/dsl-disappointments-too-bad-%0Athat-didnt-work/">flirtation with indie
DSL</a>, I called Comcast out for a third service visit to focus on
the external wiring. (Aside: This took some convincing from the service rep on
the phone; more on this later.)</p>

<p>I realized that our house had a bunch of old exterior cable wiring including a
dodgy splitter, left over from when we bought it, and entirely unused now.
Comcast hadn&rsquo;t decided to look at this before, and it hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me
that it would be related since I have no idea how things are wired downstream
of their lock box except inside my part of the house, but this time I decided
to be more careful. When the tech arrived, I asked him to open the lock box
and disconnect everything in there that I&rsquo;m not using.</p>

<p>Also, the tech took a look at the wire from the pole to the lock box and said
it doesn&rsquo;t meet their current standards and offered to replace it.</p>

<p>Other than some hilarity involving division of labor (one guy calls in the
order for new wiring, a separate guy shows up a day later and strings it, then
the first guy comes back a day later and actually connects it inside the lock
box, because the first guy doesn&rsquo;t have the cherry picker truck to string the
cable and the second guy doesn&rsquo;t have the key to the lock box?), this went
pretty smoothly.</p>

<p>So now I have shiny new wire from the pole to my house, we disconnected all
the other old wiring so from the lock box the only connected wiring is my own
new indoor wiring, and, knock on wood. one of these things was the problem and
the problem is no more.</p>

<p>(This was a month ago, and I hesitated to write about it immediately for fear
of jinxing it, but now that it&rsquo;s been a month with none of the same old
problem, I&rsquo;m feeling better about it.)</p>

<p>The promised aside: the service rep I spoke with on the phone was either a
genius or knew just enough about networking to be dangerous; I&rsquo;m not sure
which. He asked how I knew it was Comcast&rsquo;s problem and I said I&rsquo;d tried
replacing the modem already so what else could it be. He said what if it&rsquo;s my
router; I should try connecting my computer directly to the router and see if
the problem still happens. I explained how the problem only happens an average
of once every two weeks and there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m disconnecting all but one
computer in the house for weeks on end, and why should I suspect my router
anyway? Then we got in an argument about 192.168.100.1 and whether it is
indeed the address of the cable modem, as I believe, or, as he said, &ldquo;the
address my computer uses to get online&rdquo; (whatever that means). I was convinced
he was stonewalling me and he was convinced I was being difficult and this was
going nowhere so finally I said just send a tech out and he said OK but we&rsquo;ll
have to charge you if it&rsquo;s not our fault and I said fine, you&rsquo;ve already done
that twice and I&rsquo;ll just have all the charges reversed once it does turn out
to be your fault. (And I did call back later and Comcast was happy to refund
the earlier service charges once they saw they&rsquo;d had 3 calls for the same
issue.)</p>

<p>So anyway. I didn&rsquo;t find any of his facts or arguments highly convincing but
it did get me thinking &mdash; how do I know my router&rsquo;s not acting up? It doesn&rsquo;t
seem to be, but maybe. It is bleeding-edge <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a>,
after all, totally awesome in its power but not the most mainstream and tested
thing. So the next time the usual problem happened (conveniently, before the
wiring repairs mentioned above were finished), instead of power cycling the
modem I disconnected and reconnected the ethernet cable between modem and
router, thus toggling the ethernet link state. After that, connectivity was
restored &mdash; I could ping both the router and external sites &mdash; and the modem
reported no downtime.</p>

<p>That seemed like a smoking gun, but it doesn&rsquo;t explain why each Comcast wiring
repair changed the frequency of the problem. At this point I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m
dealing with multiple problems, interacting or at least masking each other in
complicated ways, and making troubleshooting that much harder. It really seems
like the wiring repairs helped materially, but if I do see more &ldquo;modem
crashes&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ll be looking hard at the router first.</p>

<p>(And to make things even more confusing, I&rsquo;ll note I&rsquo;ve also seen a handful of
&ldquo;T4 timeout&rdquo; problems where the modem complains to its logfile and then
reboots itself; that&rsquo;s definitely a Comcast-side problem; it&rsquo;s also wholly
distinct from the one I&rsquo;ve been calling &ldquo;the problem&rdquo; and easily identifiable
since the modem clearly identifies it as such; it&rsquo;s also a lot less annoying
because it only seems to happen in the middle of the night and it fixes itself
within minutes.)</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>In response to my previous articles about frustrations with my DSL modem,
Sonic.net sent me a replacement modem to see if it would fare better. It had
one specific improvement but for the most part duplicated the previous
results; however I promised to post an update, and during the extra testing I
learned one more useful fact, so this is that update with that one useful
fact.</p>

<p>That useful fact: if you have two DSL lines in bonded mode, but the DSL lines
sync at different speeds, the Comtrend 5361 modem cares a lot about which
order you connect the lines (which of the fast/slow lines is master and which
is slave).</p>

<p>In more detail: the testing I was doing involved different ways of connecting
the modem to the DSL lines (one line at a time or both lines bonded, if bonded
then testing both ways to pair the incoming lines with the modem, with and
without DSL filters, with and without additional indoor wiring, and with both
Annex A and Annex M spectrum allocation modes).</p>

<p>If the modem is configured for Annex A operation and is connected to the MPOE
with no filter and minimal indoor wiring, I see it provide the good results
you&rsquo;d expect: on either line alone, it transfers real bits at about 85% of
that line&rsquo;s claimed sync speed, and connecting both lines together, I get the
sum of the individual speeds (or 85% of the combined sync speed, which is the
same thing), and it doesn&rsquo;t matter which line is master and which line is
slave.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all as it should be. Where it gets weird is if I deviate from that
exact configuration. If I add a DSL filter, or enable Annex M, then the modem
may deliver only 1/3 of the claimed sync speed, depending on the way I connect
the 2 lines for bonded operation. Single-line operation still yields data
transfers at 85% of sync speed, and if I connect it for bonded operation with
the fast line as the master and slow line as slave I get the expected combined
rate, but if I connect the slow line as the master and the fast line as the
slave, real-world performance drops drastically. This is extra weird because
the line order doesn&rsquo;t affect the sync speed; in the bad ordering, the modem
still claims a nice fast sync speed and just can&rsquo;t transfer data nearly as
fast as it should. I&rsquo;m still at a loss to know where the performance is going
or why.</p>

<p>Now, if you know this is a problem and know how to fix it, you can route
around it. And most people probably don&rsquo;t end up with 2 DSL lines that sync at
different speeds, and I presume that if they sync at the same speed the modem
doesn&rsquo;t care how you connect them. But this weird behavior sure caused me a
lot of grief and lost time.</p>

<p>On the bright side, the newer modem did perform correctly for single-line
operation on either line, which does address my initial complaint.</p>
