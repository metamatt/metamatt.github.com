  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been wishing and waiting and watching and waiting, with an idea in my
head of what I want: from computers and the internet, regarding photos and
photo management, and connecting all the computers I use. Some of this is very
specific to photos, and some of this is general multi-computer file
management, and after years of watching and waiting, little of it is done the
way I wish it was.</p>

<p>I take photos with digital cameras. I want all of those photos accessible to
me wherever I go, on all the computers and smart devices I own and any I
happen to use temporarily; I want them backed up for safety; I want some of
them shared with my friends or the whole internet. In short: I want my
memories protected, accessible to me, and selectively shared with those I
choose to share them with.</p>

<p>There exist good file sync solutions, and there exist good backup solutions,
and there exist good photo sharing solutions, but all of them have drawbacks,
not least of which is that they&rsquo;re separate and don&rsquo;t really work together, so
I need to do more to get these combined benefits.</p>

<p>Ideally, I&rsquo;d like all photos I take immediately uploaded to a private site in
the cloud, automatically, which acts as backup and also automatically syncs
them between all my devices, and which also offers a web interface capable of
giving me full access to the collection, and selecting some photos for sharing
in a nice way, with or without authentication.</p>

<p>Since upload bandwidth is generally too slow and expensive, I want the cloud
upload to happen once, automatically and asynchronously in the background, as
soon as possible; the photo is now backed up and syncable; if I choose to
share it, there&rsquo;s no further waiting for upload.</p>

<p>I want flexible organization (which should work well with as much metadata as
I want to add, or as little), to scale to my collection of thousands of photos
over many years, and grow into the future. I want the sync solution to play
promiscuously well with other apps I choose to use, and not enforce a
particular filesystem or logical organization scheme, but I want it to offer
optional organization features which help me keep a well-groomed collection if
I can use the help. And the sync part of the solution means that any
organizational changes I make, on any connected device and in any app, is
reflected everywhere.</p>

<p>I want this to work with full-resolution photos, and raw photos, and I want it
to work with arbitrary metadata. And I want it to be promiscuously
crossplatform: on Mac and Windows and Linux desktops, and iOS and Android and
whichever other mobile platforms manage to prove their relevance.</p>

<p>I want the mobile device version to realize and revel in the constraints of
the platform, acknowledging that connectivity is ubiquitous but not always
fast or reliable, that memory is limited, and that snappy touch interactions
feel good. Thus, if I&rsquo;m using a device that combines a camera and a network
interface (any smartphone) I want every photo I take immediately sent to the
cloud for backup and syncability. I also want my entire collection synced down
to my device as a photo wallet, but, acknowledging local storage limits, I
want this to automatically downscale to an appropriate resolution, and I want
to be able to select per-device subsets of the entire collection to subscribe
to.</p>

<p>It would be great if the sync/backup/share features work with non-photo files
&mdash; the solution I envision would be file-based, and have a bunch of special
sugar for image files, but would be useful even for other files &mdash; but that&rsquo;s
not necessary. Non-photo files are already handled pretty well by services
like DropBox.</p>

<p>In fact, my continuing desire for the magic super photo cloud service is
driven by noting that by and large, photos are the only remaining file type I
have to really care about on my computer, meaning data I create that isn&rsquo;t
already well handled by cloud services. Examples that are already well
handled: Email (tons of cloud services including Gmail);  office documents
(Google Docs); unstructured notes and clippings (Evernote); miscellaneous
files that don&rsquo;t fall into the above buckets but are small (Dropbox): what&rsquo;s
left? Well, photos, music and video. But music is a special beast, which like
photos also involves largish files but unlike photos is something I buy
instead of create, meaning any individual file I want already exists in some
canonical form I can get from lots of other sources; anyway it&rsquo;s well handled:
Amazon, Apple, and Google have cloud sync; the file-based approach is somewhat
displaced by subscription services like Rhapsody and Spotify. Video is a
combination of photos and music which, in the case of video we record
ourselves, I think will end up having the same properties as photos: large
files we create, embodying our memories, that we want to sync and backup and
share. So it&rsquo;s the photos we take (and by extension I include video we take)
that we care about managing with computers, better than it&rsquo;s currently done.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a smattering of things that exist now, attacking some of the above
problems and illustrating a variety of different approaches. I&rsquo;ll call out
what they do right, and what I find lacking:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> (file sync and then some): can do most of what I&rsquo;m asking for, but it&rsquo;s not photo-specific (which could be bug or feature or both). The price is high (compared to photo sharing and backup services which usually offer unlimited storage). They have a sharing UI which has been somewhat customized for photo albums, but it&rsquo;s pretty bare bones compared to full-blown photo sharing sites. The syncing is good but not perfect; p2p sync first requires an upload to the cloud (so it makes you wait for the slow hop then skips the fast hop); it enforces a certain filesystem layout on computer clients; it doesn&rsquo;t have an appropriate mode for syncing all photos to/from smart devices at suitable resolution. All this said, Dropbox is probably the closest existing thing to what I want, and it offers good 3rd party APIs allowing others to extend it &mdash; I think they see themselves more as storage infrastructure for the web than any specific application &mdash; so if the interoperability and pricing concerns don&rsquo;t bother you, maybe it&rsquo;s already the right answer.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/features/photo-stream.html">Photo Stream</a> (photo sync): gets the sync right (the first I&rsquo;ve seen that automatically adds photos as they&rsquo;re taken). However, it has very strict and arbitrary limits: no deletion, no organization, and includes only the last 1000 photos or 30 days, so it&rsquo;s basically this write-only temporary repository that syncs across devices but which you need to manually fish the things you care about out of, and manage separately. It does have the magic auto-upload feature for network-connected cameras, and it does deal with RAW images. I see this as a promising demo of one aspect of what I&rsquo;m looking for, but it doesn&rsquo;t even touch the others (organization, backup, or sharing).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/carousel.html">Adobe Carousel</a> (photo sync and sharing): haven&rsquo;t tried it yet, and it looks promising but with limited platform support and doesn&rsquo;t handle raw files. Pricing may be a turnoff (monthly fee and limited number of carousels). Should handle sharing, both public and private. But not suitable for my entire photo library, as far as I can tell.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.crashplan.com/">CrashPlan</a> (online backup, also see Mozy, Carbonite, BackBlaze): cheap unlimited-size cloud backup, which can also let you retrieve individual files from the cloud via a web interface, which in a pinch means you can get at your files from anywhere. The web interface isn&rsquo;t optimized for this case though, nor is it optimized for photo display, and there are no suitable features for sharing (albums, delegatable access control).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> (photo sharing): Flickr is great for photo hosting and sharing; it has great organizational features and a good community. The pro version offers effectively unlimited storage and has neat tracking features so you can see the popularity of what you post. However, Flickr doesn&rsquo;t itself handle uploads or, really, client software in general, so it doesn&rsquo;t handle sync (it does have an API with good 3rd party adoption, addressing this somewhat). It doesn&rsquo;t handle RAW files, and it&rsquo;s not suitable for backup. The sharing features allow flexible public and private sharing, but with not a lot of flexibility for album display. In general, the evolution of the site has been slow since Yahoo! bought them out. I think the site was originally designed with a forward-looking vision that in the near future, nobody would need any local photo software, and you could just upload everything to Flickr, edit and organize it there, share it there, and you wouldn&rsquo;t need sync or backup. And maybe if the site had continued on its original trajectory and pace, this would have happened by now &mdash; but I find it&rsquo;s anything but true in the real world.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> (photo sharing): Facebook has huge adoption, and I&rsquo;ve found that photos I post there get seen (and &ldquo;liked&rdquo; and commented on) more than anywhere else, including Flickr. But, Facebook is a walled garden (it may be possible to use it for public photo sharing but I don&rsquo;t see people doing that in practice); content hosted there is not search engine friendly; you as the photographer also get zero control over photo presentation, zero insight into who&rsquo;s viewing your photos, and only very limited organizational features (albums with a size limit which can&rsquo;t be nested hierarchically). Person tagging and automatic face recognition make up for some of this; general ease of use and speed and reach make Facebook a good solution for sharing your photos as long as your needs are simple; however on my list of big top-level wishes (handle sync, backup, and sharing) it only touches sharing, and honestly, given the limited control over organization and presentation, I&rsquo;d prefer to use Flickr if I could get the same reach. Given the name of the site (it&rsquo;s the book of faces, after all) and the mandate implied therein, I feel like they could take this feature much much farther, but it also seems like the backup/syncing aspect I want is not part of this &ldquo;book of faces&rdquo; mandate and cries out for a dedicated solution. Note that Facebook is free and offers unlimited storage (as far as I know); the platform scales well (and is, I believe, by far the world&rsquo;s largest-volume photo server); it doesn&rsquo;t handle RAW files, or even particularly high-resolution images.</li>
<li><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/">Google&rsquo;s photo suite</a> (photo organization and sharing): Google has nice desktop client software for photo organization and editing (Picasa), which they eventually built an online companion for with sharing and automatic sync features (Picasaweb), and then integrated into their new social network, Google+. Taken together, this provides a pretty good start-to-finish solution for taking, editing, uploading, and sharing photos. However the upload/sync solution based on Picasa is not flexible or pervasive enough to serve as backup or sync files managed outside Picasa, and the website is certainly not designed to serve as a central hub for managing and syncing my entire photo library. I&rsquo;m not even sure if the sync is bidirectional; it may be upload-only.</li>
<li><a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> (generic unstructured data sync): Evernote has a good web service, with client apps and a web app for access, automatic syncing for offline access, and attractive pricing. However it doesn&rsquo;t offer any of the organization or sharing features you&rsquo;d really want for photo management, nor does it integrate with other apps via the filesystem (stuff stored in and synced via Evernote is available via the Evernote API, but not via older integration points, namely local filesystems).</li>
<li>File sync in general: Beyond Dropbox, described above, I haven&rsquo;t seen anything that really scratches this itch in the way I&rsquo;m envisioning.</li>
<li>Photo sharing in general: there are tons more photo sharing services, but by and large, they have the same properties I ascribed to Flickr above, but are less good at it. You might have a favorite that you think I&rsquo;m giving short shrift to here; fine; let me know if you know of any that are qualitatively better than Flickr on the list of things I&rsquo;m wishing for in this post.</li>
<li>Other things not mentioned here: This list is intended to show examples, not be exhaustive, so I&rsquo;ve collapsed whole categories onto one exemplar; for example, while I&rsquo;m aware of SpiderOak and see it having certain advantages over Dropbox, for my purposes here it&rsquo;s essentially the same. There are probably many other sync, backup and photo sharing services that have their own advantages but don&rsquo;t break new ground on the aspects I care about; if you know about something I missed that does address my wish list, please let me know.</li>
</ul>


<p>How I&rsquo;d build this: I&rsquo;d want the following pieces:</p>

<ol>
<li> The central cloud service which stores files securely for backup, and handles sync to any clients I&rsquo;ve authorized.</li>
<li> Client software for every platform which matters, which handles sync, automatically in the background: new files appearing first on this device are uploaded to the cloud service; new files announced from the cloud service are synced (at an appropriate resolution) down to this device&rsquo;s local library; changes to existing files (including filesystem metadata like name and location, picture-specific metadata like that encoded in EXIF and IPTC mechanisms, and image data itself) are also automatically synced in both directions.</li>
<li> Web app atop the first cloud service which handles organization and management &mdash; letting me move files between folders or albums, apply tags, and designate what to share with whom.</li>
<li> Web app for sharing, pulling authorized files from the cloud service, and displaying them with nice presentation and according to whatever organization (individual file, album, by tag, etc) I&rsquo;ve chosen.</li>
<li> Client local versions of #3 (optional and lower priority, since I should be able to use the web version or any local software I want to most things this could do).</li>
</ol>


<p>(I think Evernote, top to bottom, service to applications, is a great example
of this architecture &mdash; handling what they call &ldquo;notes&rdquo;, which basically means
document snippets with attachments &mdash; but, as described above, it doesn&rsquo;t
solve my photo sync problem, since the client local apps don&rsquo;t integrate my
local filesystem and provide an integration point for other local apps, and
the web interface doesn&rsquo;t have theorganization and display features I&rsquo;d want
for photos.)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what this should cost or what I&rsquo;d be willing to pay for it &mdash;
more than free (Google and Facebook); probably more than Flickr&rsquo;s $25/year and
more than the unlimited backup companies&#8217; $5/month; probably less than
Dropbox&rsquo;s per-GB-per-month fees. For this to be done right, the storage and
bandwidth would probably have significant cost, and most of the data is
private so can&rsquo;t be de-duped.</p>

<p>Clearly this isn&rsquo;t easy &mdash; the inherent challenges of handling and
transporting and scaling to this much data, and designing good interfaces for
all the services and applications, are real, and for anyone but the
incumbents, there are also the additional challenges of integrating with 3rd
party software and OS platforms, especially less open and less flexible mobile
platforms (given the sandboxing and multitasking restrictions in iOS, for
example, I&rsquo;m not sure anyone but Apple is in a position to implement Photo
Stream for iOS right now).</p>

<p>But it would be nice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My first impressions after playing with the Kindle Fire for an hour or so:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>it&rsquo;s basically a color, video-happy, app-happy Kindle.</p></li>
<li><p>fine for reading Kindle books, but if that&rsquo;s what you want to do, the e-ink Kindles are cheaper, lighter, less distracting, and have much better battery life.</p></li>
<li><p>video playback from Amazon&rsquo;s store or Netflix works great</p></li>
<li><p>app selection is small, but I&rsquo;ll bet a lot of games show up soon/over time</p></li>
<li><p>overall touch interaction is ok but clunky, doesn&rsquo;t quite feel right compared to iOS, scrolling is choppy, some touches aren&rsquo;t recognized, some light touches send it scrolling for miles</p></li>
<li><p>web browser feels decidedly not as fast as this year&rsquo;s Apple devices (iPad 2, iPhone 4S). So much for Silk?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, if you compare it head to head against an iPad 2, of course the iPad
comes out ahead, but it also costs 2.5x more, and is bigger and heavier. But
iOS still sets the standard for natural touch interaction, and iOS also has a
much wider app selection. Plus there&rsquo;s more hardware packed into an iPad:
camera and GPS, and options for adding external keyboards, so some people even
find they can use it as a laptop replacement… anyway, I don&rsquo;t see the Kindle
Fire having comparable versatility.</p>

<p>If you want to focus on reading, video and games, and you like the 7&#8221; size
(which is just right in many ways), the Kindle Fire is pretty compelling,
especially given the price.</p>

<p>I sure hope Amazon is rapidly improving the touch interaction via software
updates, though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wrote a <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/11/17/kindle-fire-first-impressions/">semi-positive mini-review of the Kindle Fire</a> this morning.</p>

<p>Then I read <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/11/17/kindle-fire-review">Marco Arment&rsquo;s rather scathing &ldquo;human review&rdquo;</a>, and wondered: wait a minute, if it&rsquo;s that bad, should I return it, and wait for a better version (or save my money if no better version materializes)?</p>

<p>The thing is, I saw most of the same things he did and had most of the same
complaints; I just expect Amazon to fix them. Marco sees the glass half-empty;
I see it half-full; maybe I&rsquo;m too much of an optimist. I understand that it&rsquo;s
smarter to buy something for or judge something on its current capabilities,
not ones that may or may not materialize in the future. Still, it seems worth
considering how much better the current generation hardware might be able to
get with software updates.</p>

<p>Most of the complaints centered around speed and touch interaction. And those
are legitimate &mdash; lots of taps are ignored; lots of taps are interpreted as
small drags from nowhere to nowhere; scrolling is chunky and jerky; it&rsquo;s at
best annoying and far from a premium experience. For goodness sake, the orange
pointed stripe that you drag to unlock the device, every time you want to wake
it from sleep, doesn&rsquo;t drag smoothly &mdash; it&rsquo;s the first thing you see; how hard
is it to get that right? Still, if Amazon cares &mdash; and I hope they do &mdash; they
should be able to fix this.</p>

<p>So will they (fix it)? What&rsquo;s the problem here, anyway? <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5117/amazon-kindle-fire-tore-down-has-512mb-of-ram">The hardware should be up to the task</a> &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_OMAP#OMAP_4">TI OMAP 4430 SOC</a> with two
gigahertz CPU cores on Cortex A9 architecture and PowerVR SGX540 GPU, 512MB of
RAM. That compares favorably with this year&rsquo;s Apple devices based on the A5
SOC (iPad 2, iPhone 4S: two comparable CPU cores and a somewhat newer GPU
core) and very favorably with last year&rsquo;s Apple devices based on the A4 SOC
(iPhone 4 and 4th-generation iPod Touch: one comparable CPU core and a
somewhat older GPU core). I heard that <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/14/siegler-specs">specs are dead</a>, but at least
this establishes a baseline. And note that at the Kindle Fire&rsquo;s 1024x600
screen resolution, it&rsquo;s pushing the exact same number of pixels as the 960x640
retina display in the iPhone 4 and 4S. So assuming they can figure out how to
effectively leverage the CPUs and GPU &mdash; I don&rsquo;t know how good Android is at
this, and I don&rsquo;t know what shortcuts Amazon took in forking Android, and so
on &mdash; you&rsquo;d think they should be able to get iPhone 4S-like performance out of
this. At the very least they should be able to compete with the 4th-generation
iPod Touch (which is a year old and the same price). The point is that Amazon
and Apple (and everyone else too) are using similar guts, with similar-
architecture ARM CPU cores and PowerVR GPU cores. Right now, the iPod Touch is
night and day more responsive. Amazon, get cracking.</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;ve owned the previous 2 generations of e-ink Kindle and Amazon delivered
significant software updates to these long after purchase; that gives me
reason to be hopeful the same applies to the Kindle Fire.)</p>

<p>Some of the complaints were about missing physical buttons &mdash; hardware volume
buttons would be nice, a dedicated home button would be nice, and there&rsquo;s no
way to fix those problems in software. (The headphone complaints are also
legitimate; the headphone jack location is obviously not patchable in
software; the popping might be; however I don&rsquo;t really care, because the iPod
has so won the music race that I don&rsquo;t have any desire to use the Kindle Fire
for music. I do find it notable that pretty much every non-Apple multifunction
device that <em>can</em> play music takes it so unseriously that they have popping
problems like this; that&rsquo;s par for the course with old and new Palm
smartphones too… oh well.)</p>

<p>What this boils down to is this: if Amazon can wring decent performance out of
the hardware, and pay some real attention to nitpicky details about the touch
interaction, about half of Marco&rsquo;s (and my) complaints should go away. I see
no reason this is impossible to fix with the current hardware. However, if
they also decide to yield to common sense and add hardware home and volume
buttons, the first-generation units will forever feel lacking by comparison.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll close with a final note on why I&rsquo;m willing to give the Kindle Fire some
slack. I&rsquo;m not trying to compare the Kindle Fire and iPad or argue the Kindle
Fire kills or replaces anything else, much less the iPad. But I do think the
Kindle Fire has the right guts to deliver a much better experience than it
does today, and is fixable in software if Amazon has the will to improve it.
I&rsquo;m also intrigued that there&rsquo;s finally an Android competitor to the iPod
Touch &mdash; decent hardware sold contract-free and unsubsidized for an honest
$200. (Incidentally, that&rsquo;s something <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/apples_pricing_advantage">John Gruber called out for before</a>.) The big
difference between the Kindle Fire and the iPod Touch, other than the
operating system (and the responsiveness and app ecosystem that put Apple way
ahead on the software side) is obviously the size; I&rsquo;m not going to get into
the screen size argument, other than to point out that anything that doesn&rsquo;t
fit in a pocket is clearly less portable than anything that does, and that
size imposes so many tradeoffs there&rsquo;s no one perfect size. Pick the one that
works for you.</p>

<p>Given that the $200 Android-based iPod Touch competitor now exists, I&rsquo;m
interested to see what happens with the app ecosystem. I think it could be a
big gaming success, the way the iPod Touch has been, for example.</p>

<p>If Amazon can endow it with a major dose of missing snappiness, that is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the MMRF: They raised about $525K via this marathon, which is one third of
their overall events-based fundraising for the year. (And this year was a
record high.) $4300 of that was from you all, so one more big thank-you from
me, the MMRF, and the people they try to help.</p>

<p>For the marathon as a whole: Conditions were great, and the top 3 men all beat
the previous course record. You can find plenty of news stories on this if
you&rsquo;re curious.</p>

<p>For me: I originally started training for this marathon (my first) with a goal
of finishing in under 4 hours, which is about 9 minutes per mile. Towards the
middle of my training, it became obvious that I&rsquo;d be able to exceed that goal
and revised it to somewhere between a very optimistic 8 minutes per mile (3:30
total) to a more realistic 8:30 per mile (3:45 total). I ran with my friend
Jeff pacing me (he&rsquo;s run a couple marathons before) and we set out with a goal
of starting with 8:30 miles and speeding up as we went.</p>

<p>Of course, at the beginning we felt great and it was hard to run the exact
speed we&rsquo;d planned. We did the first 6 miles a little slower than 8 minutes,
then still felt strong so we sped up a little. Up through the first 16 miles
(which is right where the course enters Manhattan for the first time) I felt
great. At 16 miles I began to feel only good, but we kept the pace around 8
minutes per mile until mile 22, where a couple things happened: I began to
feel not great at all, there&rsquo;s a very mild but very long uphill leading into
Central Park, and I decided I needed to slow down. Jeff stayed strong and went
on ahead; I slowed down by about a minute a mile, did the last 4 miles at
about a 9:30 pace, and finished in 3:37:19. (Jeff finished in 3:32:35, and I
say thanks to Jeff for pulling me along at a strong pace and congrats for
being able to stick it out the whole way.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because during the first 16 miles I felt like I should go do this
every day, and during the last 4 miles I never wanted to do it again, and
after finishing, of course, my feelings (a little more detached and not in the
middle of a runner&rsquo;s high or extreme pain) are somewhere in between. During
those last 4 miles, I knew I had to just keep slogging on to the finish; I
couldn&rsquo;t quite keep the 8 minute pace but I knew I had to keep running;
slowing down any more wouldn&rsquo;t have felt better; the only thing that would
have felt good at that point was quitting, and I knew that wasn&rsquo;t an option,
not least because of yall&rsquo;s support.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m very happy with the result for my first marathon, and looking
back, I don&rsquo;t know if the pain and the subsequent slowdown in the last 4 miles
is (a) because we went out too fast, (b) because I didn&rsquo;t do quite enough
training at a >20 mile distance, &copy; lack of fuel, or (d) totally normal and
that&rsquo;s why they call it a marathon.</p>

<p>I also have to praise the marathon organizers &mdash; this race had the best
organization (website, runner tracking, getting to the start line, knowing
what to expect), the best infrastructure (timing mats almost every mile,
drinks and food along the way), and the best cheering crowd of any race I&rsquo;ve
ever been involved in. That&rsquo;s what I was told to expect ahead of time, but it
sure lived up to expectations. If you&rsquo;ve run NYC before you know what I&rsquo;m
talking about, and if you haven&rsquo;t and you&rsquo;re a runner, do consider it. It
really was a great experience.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re curious for any more details, the marathon website has the detailed
splits available &mdash; go to <a href="http://trackmyrunners.ingnycmarathon.org/Runners.aspx">http://trackmyrunners.ingnycmarathon.org/Runners.aspx</a> and search for Ginzton. Then click the +
button on the far right, and it&rsquo;ll turn my name into a link which you can

  <div class="entry-content"><p>RIP Steve Jobs. Along with his passing, everyone in the tech world seems to be
telling their <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/10/the-first-time-i-used-an-apple-computer-was.ars">stories about Apple&rsquo;s influence on them in their formative years</a>; here&rsquo;s mine.</p>

<p>Like Eric Bangeman in the above-linked Ars Technica article, my first computer
wasn&rsquo;t an Apple II &mdash; I also had contemporary experience with TRS-80, TI
99-4/A, and Commodore 64 machines. Unlike him, my first experiences with the
Apple II didn&rsquo;t stand out as more satisfying &mdash; I actually was touched more
deeply by the Commodore 64, likely because it was so much cheaper my family
could afford one much sooner. But I did spend a lot of time playing with an
Apple II+ at a friend&rsquo;s house. Lots of Moon Patrol on the C64, lots of Lode
Runner on the II+, lots of BASIC programming on both… the C64 was a very
gentle introduction to these newfangled home computers, since you could plug
it into any TV, and it worked fine with no storage (games came on cartridges),
or with very cheap storage (cassette tape adapter), or you could buy a disk
drive. And the C64 had color graphics and better sound support than the
contemporary Apple II models… on the other hand, Apple&rsquo;s BASIC actually had
graphics commands, which on the C64 forced you into machine language
territory.</p>

<p>Later I got an Apple IIc, and it was better in many ways than the Commodore 64
&mdash; but in other ways not much better, or no better at all, especially
considering the price. I really appreciated the democratizing influence of the
Commodore&rsquo;s price &mdash; they were available for $150 at Toys &lsquo;R&rsquo; Us, IIRC.</p>

<p>As it became time to upgrade the IIc, the original Macintosh was already on
the scene, and I had a choice &mdash; jump to Mac, or upgrade to the latest and
greatest Apple II, the IIgs. It seemed like an easy choice at the time &mdash; the
IIgs was backwards compatible with the software and peripherals I already had,
had color graphics and awesome sound, was expandable, and was roughly
equivalently powerful. Only a couple years later, Apple made it obvious they
were betting only on the Mac, finally introducing a Mac which supported color
and expandability, and essentially killed off the IIgs. (They did continue to
release impressive software updates for the IIgs, including a couple complete
rewrites of its GS/OS operating system, which I take to mean that the IIgs
software team felt much as I did about their machine&rsquo;s demise.)</p>

<p>This was a real blow to me &mdash; the IIgs had been a stretch for my family to
afford, and I don&rsquo;t recall any hints at the time from Apple that it would be a
dead-end purchase &mdash; so, with the wrath that only a 12 year old boy can
muster, I swore that I&rsquo;d never buy another Apple product. (Only much later did
I realize that this coincided with the Steveless interregnum at Apple, opening
the door for me to reverse this pledge later.)</p>

<p>Thus was kicked off a 15 year period of PC buying, where I learned the use and
programming of MS-DOS and then Windows, from 286 to 386 to 486 and Pentium and
beyond, and again the democratizing influence of the Wintel economy was
attractive &mdash; people have long claimed that Apple computers were an overpriced
item for the snob market, and while we all know that&rsquo;s not true and even the
stereotype has mostly dissolved, it&rsquo;s still worth examining a little deeper.
It&rsquo;s now widely accepted &mdash; and if you look closely you realize it&rsquo;s been true
even longer &mdash; that Apple computers offer a good value for the money you do
spend, and compare favorably with PCs at the same price point. And yet, there
were often lower price points, satisfied only by PCs, that were still good
enough to be relevant. Probably Steve Jobs didn&rsquo;t feel that way, but I know I
did, with the C64 in 1982, and with my 386 in 1992.</p>

<p>In high school, as a staffer and eventually editor of our school paper, we did
most everything on Macs &mdash; a few Mac Classics, and later one color IIci. They
were underpowered and slow, and we cursed them often, but they did the job and
most of the curses were affectionate. They also networked, which was something
PCs of the day didn&rsquo;t easily do. Unlike standalone computers, networked
computers need names &mdash; I don&rsquo;t remember all of them, but two of them were
Eddie Vedder and Kurt Cobain, provoking utterances like &ldquo;dammit, Kurt Cobain
crashed again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In college in the later 90&rsquo;s, learning about CS fundamentals and history and
non-consumer architectures and Unix and operating systems and the impact of
the MMU, it became obvious that neither Mac OS (stalled at System 7) nor
Windows (in the throes of the 9x procession) was really living up to the
promise of performance and reliability supported by the hardware that was
commonplace at this time, but that Windows 9x was closer &mdash; at least most of
the software ran preemptively scheduled separate memory spaces, and its mostly
backwards compatible cousin Windows NT could even be called a real OS. So it
was easy for me to continue looking askance at Macs (while, to be sure, my Mac
loving friends looked equally askance at Windows machines, and I&rsquo;m sure we
both claimed the other crashed more). However you look at it, this was not the
proudest period for the Mac, while Apple kept trying and failing to get its
house in order with Taligent and Pink.</p>

<p>Around this time Steve Jobs returned to Apple, and kicked off efforts to
revitalize both the software and hardware behind the Mac. The hardware efforts
paid off right away, with the bondi blue iMac and later iBook; the software
efforts would take longer. I wasn&rsquo;t the least bit tempted by these fruity
looking computers, running the same tired Mac OS derivatives (8 and 9 being
like Windows 98 and ME, that is, not meaningfully better than what they
succeeded), and the IIgs experience still smarted, 10 years later.</p>

<p>This remained basically true until OS X came out &mdash; a Mac OS a geek could run,
and still respect himself in the morning &mdash; and with it, the white iBook,
which both in appearance and in internals was far more respectable than its
predecessor. Just as I was graduating from college, I used my Apple student
discount and bought one, finally breaking my age-12 promise.</p>

<p>The early revs of OS X (beta, and 10.0, and 10.1) showed a lot of promise but
they were still new, under optimized and slow, and the iBook&rsquo;s hardware wasn&rsquo;t
enough to compensate for this, and I never ended up using it for anything
serious, deferring to more capable PC hardware I continued to buy. A year
later, I traded the iBook away as a partial payment for a Ducati motorcycle.
However, the hook was set and a couple years later, as OS X hit its stride
with 10.2 and G4 processors became affordable, that underpowered feel was
gone; I bought a G4 laptop, was won over by several factors that really matter
on laptops (suspend/resume that&rsquo;s reliable, wifi that&rsquo;s reliable, combining to
mean you can open the lid and be online and typing a few seconds later &mdash;
something that was a total crapshoot under Windows at the time and, um, still
mostly is another 7 years later), and, to close with another reference to
Bangeman, every computer I&rsquo;ve bought since that I didn&rsquo;t build myself has been
a Mac.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/07/26/nyc-marathon/">planning to run the NYC Marathon in November</a>, as
described earlier.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also going to run the first half of the SF Marathon this coming Sunday.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in helping support my donation campaign for the NYC
Marathon, I&rsquo;d like to propose a fun challenge based on how I do in the &frac12;
marathon this weekend.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve run this &frac12; marathon before, 3 years ago, and finished in 1 hour 52
minutes &mdash; just a little faster than a 9-minute-per-mile pace. My training
goal for this time is an 8:00-per-mile pace (1 hour 45 minutes overall), and
my last couple training runs were at about 8:05 per mile. But I think I can do
it faster.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be happy with an 8:00 pace &mdash; substantially faster than my current record
for this race &mdash; but even happier with 7:40 (just over 1 hour 40 minutes
total). Want to bet I can&rsquo;t do it? I&rsquo;ll bet I can run 7:40 miles and you bet I
can&rsquo;t run faster than 8:00 miles and we&rsquo;ll both donate to the MMRF based on
the difference.</p>

<p>So. If you&rsquo;d like to take this challenge, and challenge me to run faster than
8:00 miles this weekend, let me know and give me a dollar amount per second.
I&rsquo;ll promise to donate that amount for every second slower than 7:40 I run
(average pace), and you promise to donate that amount for every second faster
than 8:00 I run.</p>

<p>Example: you bet me $5 per second, and I finish with an average of 7:45. You
donate $75, and I donate $25. Of course, if I finish with an average of 7:55,
you donate $25 and I donate $75.</p>

<p>I chose these times because it&rsquo;ll push me to run a little faster than
otherwise, and it stands a good chance of raising some money for the MMRF (as
opposed to, say, if I just bet you over/under 8:00, then there&rsquo;s no
disincentive to run slower and they get less money).</p>

<p>Of course, if you&rsquo;d like to make a normal less complicated donation to the
MMRF in support of my marathon bid, that&rsquo;s welcome too, and <a href="http://www.active.com/donate/2011mmrfNYC/NYFULLMGinzton">my fundraising page is here</a>.</p>

<p>But if this complicated challenge sounds fun and/or you want to make me sweat
more, please contact me (email, comments here, comments on Facebook, carrier
pigeon…) with your bet amount.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve signed up to run the New York City marathon in November. It&rsquo;ll be my
first marathon, so both training and the actual event should be interesting
and challenging.</p>

<p>In addition to the personal challenge, I&rsquo;m running on a team collecting
donations for the <a href="http://themmrf.org/">Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation</a>.
(Before anyone freaks out, no, I don&rsquo;t have any direct connection to this
disease, neither I nor any of my immediate relatives or acquaintances. I chose
to fundraise for them because my mom and her oncologist husband say they do
good research and use their money wisely. And as my mom said, &ldquo;The fight
against any kind of cancer benefits the fight against all kinds of cancer.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>If you can spare $20, or more, or less, to sponsor me and support the MMRF, I,
the MMRF, and multiple myeloma patients present and future would all
appreciate it: <a href="http://www.active.com/donate/2011mmrfNYC/NYFULLMGinzton">just follow this link to my fundraising page</a>. Thank you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My outbound Internet connection stopped working again this morning, and (like
the last couple times) evidence pointed towards my router, not the modem or
anything provided by Comcast.</p>

<p>(As I said <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/06/13/update-on-comcast-last-mile-isp-connection/">last time</a>, I&rsquo;m convinced there were originally
multiple problems leading to confusion and increasing troubleshooting
difficulty, but it appears I owe Comcast at least a partial apology.)</p>

<p>The good news is there&rsquo;s a software fix, which can be invoked remotely
(unfortunately not from outside the house since outbound connectivity is down,
but it does mean I don&rsquo;t have to walk over to the equipment closet to power
cycle modems or routers): &ldquo;mii-tool -r -R eth1&rdquo; made everything happy again.</p>

<p>The router in question is a <a href="http://www.netgear.com/home/products/wirelessrouters/high-performance/WNDR3700.aspx">Netgear WNDR3700</a> running <a href="http://backfire.openwrt.org/10.03/README">OpenWrt 10.03 &ldquo;backfire&rdquo;</a>. I wonder whether this
happens to others and whether it&rsquo;s a hardware or software bug. I&rsquo;m hoping a
newer version of OpenWrt might fix it (but since release candidates of 10.03.1
have been appearing for 15 months now, I&rsquo;m giving up hope for a new official
release; newer version probably just means trunk); alternately, it won&rsquo;t be
too hard to whip up a monitoring script that tries to ping the modem and does
the mii-tool reset whenever it doesn&rsquo;t see a response.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/02/15/mac-os-x-bugs-apples-never-gonna-fix/">complained</a> that Fast User Switching over a Screen Sharing connection is a bag of hurt, and that it seems like something Apple&rsquo;s never going to fix (#4 on the list at that link).</p>

<p>(Fingers crossed), maybe I was wrong: the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/features.html#screensharing">what&rsquo;s-new page for Lion</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> advertises per-user screen sharing, which sounds more like the Microsoft Windows Terminal Server approach: a combination of fast user switching and remote access, so that multiple sessions can be active simultaneously, and remote sessions aren&rsquo;t onscreen on the local console.</p>

<p>I can only hope that this new feature will make the old bug go away; I have a hard time imagining how they&rsquo;d implement detached remote sessions that still result in the buggy behavior I described. Though, from the bug I described and earlier incarnations that seemed related, it seems that headless isn&rsquo;t a primary/supported use case in Apple&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping it gets better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/07/state-of-the-last-mile-internet-connection-year-2009/">months of woe with my Comcast cable connection</a>, and a couple months of <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/21/dsl-disappointments-too-bad-%20that-didnt-work/">flirtation with indie DSL</a>, I called Comcast out for a third service visit to focus on the external wiring. (Aside: This took some convincing from the service rep on the phone; more on this later.)</p>

<p>I realized that our house had a bunch of old exterior cable wiring including a
dodgy splitter, left over from when we bought it, and entirely unused now.
Comcast hadn&rsquo;t decided to look at this before, and it hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me
that it would be related since I have no idea how things are wired downstream
of their lock box except inside my part of the house, but this time I decided
to be more careful. When the tech arrived, I asked him to open the lock box
and disconnect everything in there that I&rsquo;m not using.</p>

<p>Also, the tech took a look at the wire from the pole to the lock box and said
it doesn&rsquo;t meet their current standards and offered to replace it.</p>

<p>Other than some hilarity involving division of labor (one guy calls in the
order for new wiring, a separate guy shows up a day later and strings it, then
the first guy comes back a day later and actually connects it inside the lock
box, because the first guy doesn&rsquo;t have the cherry picker truck to string the
cable and the second guy doesn&rsquo;t have the key to the lock box?), this went
pretty smoothly.</p>

<p>So now I have shiny new wire from the pole to my house, we disconnected all
the other old wiring so from the lock box the only connected wiring is my own
new indoor wiring, and, knock on wood. one of these things was the problem and
the problem is no more.</p>

<p>(This was a month ago, and I hesitated to write about it immediately for fear
of jinxing it, but now that it&rsquo;s been a month with none of the same old
problem, I&rsquo;m feeling better about it.)</p>

<p>The promised aside: the service rep I spoke with on the phone was either a
genius or knew just enough about networking to be dangerous; I&rsquo;m not sure
which. He asked how I knew it was Comcast&rsquo;s problem and I said I&rsquo;d tried
replacing the modem already so what else could it be. He said what if it&rsquo;s my
router; I should try connecting my computer directly to the router and see if
the problem still happens. I explained how the problem only happens an average
of once every two weeks and there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m disconnecting all but one
computer in the house for weeks on end, and why should I suspect my router
anyway? Then we got in an argument about 192.168.100.1 and whether it is
indeed the address of the cable modem, as I believe, or, as he said, &ldquo;the
address my computer uses to get online&rdquo; (whatever that means). I was convinced
he was stonewalling me and he was convinced I was being difficult and this was
going nowhere so finally I said just send a tech out and he said OK but we&rsquo;ll
have to charge you if it&rsquo;s not our fault and I said fine, you&rsquo;ve already done
that twice and I&rsquo;ll just have all the charges reversed once it does turn out
to be your fault. (And I did call back later and Comcast was happy to refund
the earlier service charges once they saw they&rsquo;d had 3 calls for the same
issue.)</p>

<p>So anyway. I didn&rsquo;t find any of his facts or arguments highly convincing but
it did get me thinking &mdash; how do I know my router&rsquo;s not acting up? It doesn&rsquo;t
seem to be, but maybe. It is bleeding-edge <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a>,
after all, totally awesome in its power but not the most mainstream and tested
thing. So the next time the usual problem happened (conveniently, before the
wiring repairs mentioned above were finished), instead of power cycling the
modem I disconnected and reconnected the ethernet cable between modem and
router, thus toggling the ethernet link state. After that, connectivity was
restored &mdash; I could ping both the router and external sites &mdash; and the modem
reported no downtime.</p>

<p>That seemed like a smoking gun, but it doesn&rsquo;t explain why each Comcast wiring
repair changed the frequency of the problem. At this point I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m
dealing with multiple problems, interacting or at least masking each other in
complicated ways, and making troubleshooting that much harder. It really seems
like the wiring repairs helped materially, but if I do see more &ldquo;modem
crashes&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ll be looking hard at the router first.</p>

<p>(And to make things even more confusing, I&rsquo;ll note I&rsquo;ve also seen a handful of
&ldquo;T4 timeout&rdquo; problems where the modem complains to its logfile and then
reboots itself; that&rsquo;s definitely a Comcast-side problem; it&rsquo;s also wholly
distinct from the one I&rsquo;ve been calling &ldquo;the problem&rdquo; and easily identifiable
since the modem clearly identifies it as such; it&rsquo;s also a lot less annoying
because it only seems to happen in the middle of the night and it fixes itself
within minutes.)</p>
