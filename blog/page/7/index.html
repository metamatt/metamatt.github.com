  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yet another disappointment with the DSL connection and/or modem from
Sonic.net: Annex M doesn&rsquo;t seem to do any good at all for upload speeds.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/09/state-of-the-last-mile-%0Ainternet-connection-year-2011/">As I wrote in my introductory post on
Sonic.net,</a> the whole reason I was willing to consider
them (or DSL technology at all) was the promise of decent upload speeds. The
last DSL connection I had was only 768kbps upstream, and even ADSL2+ promises
only about 1mbps upstream, but Sonic.net offers this Annex M configuration
which trades some downstream bandwidth for upstream bandwidth, with upstream
speeds theoretically as high as 3.3mbps (Sonic claims 2.5mbps is more typical
real-world performance on a good line). Given that Sonic makes it easy to
double these speeds by combining two lines together, now we&rsquo;re talking &mdash; a
combined 5mbps upstream would compare decently with what I&rsquo;m getting from
Comcast&rsquo;s DOCSIS 3 technology.</p>

<p>(It&rsquo;s hard to know exactly what real-world speeds to expect from Annex M.
Sonic&rsquo;s baseline for a single ADSL2+ line under good conditions, using the
default Annex A configuration, is 20mbps/1mbps, or 40mbps/2mbps across 2
lines. Annex M should increase upload speeds to as much as 2.5mbps per line,
but at at unknown cost to downstream speeds &mdash; I haven&rsquo;t found anyone willing
to predict that. It seems a reasonable estimate would be somewhere between the
following hypothetical best case and worst case: best case, I added 1.5mbps of
upstream, so it should cost me 1.5mbps of downstream; worst case, I multiplied
upstreams speed by 2.5, so my downstream speed will be divided by 2.5. Using
those as upper and lower bounds, I should expect something between 8mbps and
18mbps remaining downstream per line, or 16-36mbps/5mbps combined, with Annex
M. That would compare favorably enough with the 32mbps/7.5mbps I&rsquo;m getting
from Comcast that, given the reliability problems and caps I&rsquo;m also getting
from Comcast, I&rsquo;d be happy to switch.)</p>

<p>As described in my <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/09/state-%0Aof-the-last-mile-internet-connection-year-2011/">earlier</a>
<a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/post/4719413815/dsl-modem-annoyances-%0Amisleading-sync-speed-edition">posts</a>, after two months of asking Sonic to ask AT&amp;T
to provide wiring that will sustain a good ADSL2+ signal, I have one line
syncing at 18mbps and one line syncing at only 4mbps (downstream speeds, using
Annex A). Still, I figured I might as well see the results of the Annex M
spectrum reallocation, so last Friday I called Sonic and asked them to enable
Annex M on both lines.</p>

<p>Then I went to the modem&rsquo;s status page to see the effect on sync speeds. (If
you followed my recent post on <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/post/4719413815/dsl-modem-annoyances-%0Amisleading-sync-speed-edition">sync speeds vs actual transfer
speeds</a>, all tests here were done at the MPOE with no
filter, that is, the best case from those earlier tests.)</p>

<p>First annoyance: the modem wouldn&rsquo;t sync at all, on either line, until I
enabled Annex M on both lines. Maybe this is how it&rsquo;s designed to work, but
from earlier reading of Sonic&rsquo;s site (2 months ago when I first signed up, all
excited by Annex M) that&rsquo;s not the impression I got. Reading again now, the
<a href="http://sonic.net/support/faq/advanced/annexm.shtml">Annex M FAQ</a> doesn&rsquo;t say
one way or the other, but <a href="http://corp.sonic.net/ceo/2010/04/20/fusion-annex-m-available-for-testing-%0Ain-santa-rosa/">Dane&rsquo;s post introducing Annex
M</a> seems to imply it&rsquo;s safe to leave it on on the network end and
toggle it at will on your end. That would be more convenient, but for my
Comtrend 5361 at least, the behavior is: if the network end is set to Annex A
and the modem is set to Annex M, it syncs using Annex A (good), but if the
network end is set to Annex M and the modem is set to Annex A, it doesn&rsquo;t sync
at all (bad).</p>

<p>Annoying, but not a deal-breaker. Let&rsquo;s see how the speeds compare. I&rsquo;ll give
numbers even for the broken configurations that didn&rsquo;t sync, since I did test
those combinations and the results are interesting.</p>

<p>All of the following tests are with Annex M enabled for both lines on Sonic&rsquo;s
end, and at my end with the modem plugged directly into the MPOE with no
filter. Speed test results are from speedtest.sonic.net.</p>

<p>Both master and slave lines set to Annex M:</p>

<ul>
<li>Master sync: 2.54/1.08</li>
<li>Slave sync: 12.51/1.14</li>
<li>Combined sync: 15.06/2.23</li>
<li>Speed test: 5.92/1.83</li>
</ul>


<p>Master on Annex M, slave on Annex A:</p>

<ul>
<li>Master sync: 2.54/1.08</li>
<li>Slave sync: no sync</li>
<li>Combined sync: 2.54/1.08</li>
<li>Speed test: 2.17/0.88</li>
</ul>


<p>Master on Annex A, slave on Annex M:</p>

<ul>
<li>Master sync: no sync</li>
<li>Slave sync: 12.62/1.14</li>
<li>Combined sync: 12.62/1.14</li>
<li>Speed test: 10.82/0.96</li>
</ul>


<p>Both master and slave set to Annex A:</p>

<ul>
<li>Master sync: no sync</li>
<li>Slave sync: no sync</li>
<li>Speed test: N/A</li>
</ul>


<p>As a comparison point, here are my most recent numbers for a comparable test
with Annex A on both ends:</p>

<ul>
<li>Master sync: 4.84/1.08</li>
<li>Slave sync: 18.36/1.15</li>
<li>Combined sync: 23.12/2.23</li>
<li>Speed test: 19.72/1.83</li>
</ul>


<p>So, two things to note here.</p>

<p>First, Annex M significantly decreases downstream speed without increasing
upstream speed at all, for me. Compare the sync speeds above for Annex A and
Annex M. The best sync speed I saw for the slow line was 53% of what it was
without Annex M; the best sync speed I saw for the fast line was 69% of what
it was without Annex M; the combined sync speed was 76% of what it was without
Annex M.</p>

<p>Second, Annex M hurt my transfer speeds even more than the claimed sync
speeds. Note the oddity that while bonded operation results in a faster sync
speed than connecting the fast line only, when I measure the actual transfer
speed, it actually got slower. (That&rsquo;s reminiscent of <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/post/4719413815/dsl-%0Amodem-annoyances-misleading-sync-speed-edition">the earlier bonding
experiments I ran with Annex A</a>.). The single-line Annex M
tests both transferred data at the 85% of claimed sync speed that I&rsquo;ve come to
expect, but using both lines bonded together, this ratio drops to only 39%.</p>

<p>Again, I&rsquo;m curious why bonding the lines results in slower operation than one
line alone, without this effect being visible in sync speeds or ATM errors.
And unless something is completely wrong here, it looks like Annex M does not,
for me, bring DSL back into the realm of competitive upload speeds.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently wrote a post, <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/13/on-searching-ones-own-%0Aactivity-streams/">On searching one&rsquo;s own activity
streams</a>, lamenting the difficulty of finding stuff I myself had
posted on Facebook and Twitter. In response to that post, a friend pointed
out: &ldquo;You may be looking for <a href="https://www.greplin.com/">Greplin</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Intrigued, I gave Greplin a try, and overall I&rsquo;m impressed. It&rsquo;s a new service
that indexes data you create, on other sites and services like Facebook,
Twitter, Gmail and associated Google services like Calendar, and Evernote.
(Note that most of these involve indexing data that&rsquo;s not publicly available,
so Greplin needs access to your account data &mdash; it uses OAuth to request this
access without needing to know your password.)</p>

<p>This goes well beyond what I was asking for in the stream-search post, and
actually nicely answers something else I&rsquo;d been wanting recently, and overall
I&rsquo;m impressed (and slightly jealous I didn&rsquo;t get to it first).</p>

<p>But, back to the specific &ldquo;find my own Facebook&rdquo; posts case that led me to
Greplin in the first place: I tried searching for a few of my own posts, and
it didn&rsquo;t find them. It seems pretty good about finding tweets, mail messages,
appointments, and pretty much everything else it&rsquo;s supposed to including
Facebook messages, but not Facebook wall posts. I went looking for answers in
Greplin&rsquo;s help system. From the <a href="http://help.greplin.com/customer/portal/articles/4766-which-sites-%0Adoes-greplin-index-">&ldquo;which sites does Greplin index&rdquo; article in
their FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Please note that for news feed and wall posts, Facebook only allows us to
collect data from a few days before you began your index on Greplin. However,
we will collect all your data from that point forward. This means that you may
not find Facebook news feed or wall post items that were created up to 4 days
prior to your initial signup for Greplin.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ouch. I don&rsquo;t know whether that&rsquo;s a policy or technical limitation. I don&rsquo;t
believe it&rsquo;s a technical limitation, because I wrote my own little Python
script to download my own status messages since the beginning of time, and
comments on those status messages, and they&rsquo;re all available via the API.</p>

<p>That seems to leave policy as the limitation. I sure hope that Facebook isn&rsquo;t
preventing 3rd party sites, with my permission, from looking at my own data. I
can&rsquo;t see any consistency in letting Greplin access my very recent posts and
my future posts but not my past posts. Especially because if they&rsquo;re not
allowed to index old content, and they want to index content going forward
(and the ability to rebuild the index as necessary), that pretty much requires
them to keep a separate copy of my data, whereas if they had reasonable access
to past data, they could rely on Facebook to store it and provide it as
necessary and they would need only the index on their side.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tumblr&rsquo;s editor turned t<a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/11%0A/this-is-why-you-need-a-groklaw/">his post</a> into <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/metamatt/5621005740%0A/in/photostream/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/526%0A3/5621005740_174256464b.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>between the time I pressed &ldquo;Create Post&rdquo; (at which time there was no CSS gunk
visible) and the time it was actually published (where some CSS crept into the
post body itself).</p>

<p>(This happened both on Tumblr itself and in the wall post that the Tumblrbot
made on Facebook &mdash; I immediately went and fixed the damage in the original
post, but the Facebook publish feature is basically instant and doesn&rsquo;t allow
after the fact edits, so the CSS gunk is forever baked into that post and
that&rsquo;s why the screenshot shows Facebook and not Tumblr. Also, Tumblr
apparently bakes the RSS feed with enough delay that my subsequent edit to fix
the post made it into the RSS version, unlike the Facebook version.)</p>

<p>This problem isn&rsquo;t incredibly common, but common enough to be annoying &mdash;
maybe something like 5% of the time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the potential upsides to posting stuff on Twitter or Facebook ought to
be that you can find it later when you want to know what you were
doing/thinking/saying at a given time.</p>

<p>Too bad neither site has a good way of searching your own contributions.</p>

<p>Twitter does have a search feature and you can restrict it to your own tweets
by adding your username but it only returns very recent tweets (like maybe the
last week); Twitter is also indexed by the major web search engines and if you
add &ldquo;site:twitter.com username&rdquo; to your queries you may or may not find what
you&rsquo;re looking for with minimal additional cruft; there&rsquo;s also <a href="http://snapbird.org/">Snap
Bird</a> which is a 3rd party site designed to do this but
it&rsquo;s clunky and I&rsquo;ve never seen it actually work (maybe the fault of Twitter&rsquo;s
API, who knows).</p>

<p>Facebook does have a search feature but it inexplicably doesn&rsquo;t search your
own updates (it finds people and pages and if you click the &ldquo;See more results
for…&rdquo; link then a tantalizing &ldquo;posts from friends&rdquo; link appears which doesn&rsquo;t
seem to find content in posts by me or my friends); Facebook is a walled
garden and its content is generally not indexable by external search engines;
it does have a pretty good API and so somebody could probably go build this as
a 3rd party app but I&rsquo;m not aware of one, and arguably it would be better done
as part of the core site anyway.</p>

<p>So, on those occasions I do want to go track down one of my own updates on
either of these sites, I resort to viewing my own profile, then scrolling
down, and clicking the &ldquo;show older posts&rdquo; link as necessary, and scrolling
down, and repeating until I&rsquo;ve gone back a couple months, and using my
browser&rsquo;s find-in-page feature to find what I&rsquo;m looking for, eventually after
way too much clicking and scrolling.</p>

<p>Not only is this ridiculous, it&rsquo;s made even worse by an interaction with
Google Chrome (and maybe other browsers, but Chrome&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m using lately).
Apparently the AJAXy way these sites use DOM writes or whatever they do to
append content to the current page without reloading triggers this behavior in
Chrome where &ldquo;Find Again&rdquo; (ctrl-G or Command-G) doesn&rsquo;t find text in newly
added parts of the page. So often, I&rsquo;ll load the page and scroll back a month
or so and then use the browser Find command to search for &ldquo;widgets&rdquo; and not
find it, then scroll another month or so and then hit Command-G and not find
it, then scroll back another month or so and so on… and after going back 6 or
7 months, I&rsquo;ll remember that Command-G doesn&rsquo;t work, and cancel the search and
repeat the search with Command-F and <em>then</em> command-G and then it will find it
halfway up the page, which I would have found a lot easier if Command-G had
worked the first applicable time. (This was a pattern I learned with earlier
versions of Chrome; using Chrome 10, it&rsquo;s a little different &mdash; the first
Command-G may actually scroll the search hit into view, but it won&rsquo;t highlight
it and you won&rsquo;t notice it on a busy page, and it will keep reporting &ldquo;0 of 0&rdquo;
in the search status pane; you still need to do the 3-step deselect, Find,
Find Again dance to get it to highlight.)</p>

<p>(Side note on Facebook: there&rsquo;s a <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/128906/How-to-search-%0Athrough-your-own-Facebook-profile">metafilter question asking how to search
your own Facebook profile</a>; not only do the answers there not have a
solution, but the overall feeling is highly negative on it even being
possible. That&rsquo;s not quite true; I&rsquo;ve confirmed that using the Facebook API
from a simple Python script I can get back anything I ever posted. They do
keep it, and they or someone else could write an indexer and search tool.)</p>

<p>Update: <a href="https://greplin.com">Greplin</a> does a pretty good job of this, though
<a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/15/how-to-search-your-own-%0Aactivity-streams-greplin/">not as good a job as it could with Facebook
posts</a>.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>For <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/09%0A/state-of-the-last-mile-internet-connection-year-2011/">my dual-line Fusion setup</a>, Sonic.net sent me a
Comtrend Nexuslink 5361.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an ADSL2+ modem that works with one line, or two lines bonded together,
and also includes normal home wireless router functionality (NAT firewall, 4
ethernet ports, and Wi-Fi).</p>

<p>My specific complaint here is that the way they wired it to accept 2 DSL lines
is annoying. It&rsquo;s got a single <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regist%0Aered_jack#RJ11.2C_RJ14.2C_RJ25_wiring_details">RJ14 jack</a>, so both lines enter it there,
on the inner and outer pair of the same jack. The problem is that it considers
the outer pair to be line 1 (primary/master) and the inner pair to be line 2
(slave). And if you connect only the slave line, it will establish ADSL sync
but will not carry IP traffic (it looks like it never even acquires an IP
address and gateway via DHCP).</p>

<p>If you connect only the master line, or both master and slave, then it works
fine and carries IP traffic. But the way they wired it, it&rsquo;s much easier to
connect only the slave. (In fact, some Sonic.net support personnel told me
they thought this modem doesn&rsquo;t support single-line operation, which is
probably because they&rsquo;d tried plugging it in the straightforward way and
found, indeed, it didn&rsquo;t work.)</p>

<p>The reason this is a problem is that any single-line (RJ11) phone jack you
have will only have the inner pair active. If you connect that to this modem
with a standard phone cord (with either 1 or 2 pairs), you&rsquo;ve connected the
active pair to the inner pair on the modem, which is the slave line which will
sync but will not alone carry traffic.</p>

<p>And the way AT&amp;T&rsquo;s wires <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_point">terminate at the
MPOE</a>, each line goes to a
separate test jack (an RJ11 jack, so on the inner pair), and a separate set of
terminals, and it&rsquo;s up to the customer how it&rsquo;s wired from there. I connected
an RJ14 jack to both lines, the inner pair connected to one phone line and the
outer pair connected to the other phone line, which is the standard way of
wiring a 2-line setup, and I can patch that jack directly to the modem with a
standard 2-line phone cable to activate both lines. This setup is fine for
actual use, but if I&rsquo;m having problems, it&rsquo;s unnecessarily difficult to
troubleshoot.</p>

<p>The problem is that no standard phone cable gives you an easy way of
connecting just the outer pair. A standard 1-line phone cable will connect the
inner pair to the inner pair. A standard 2-line phone cable will connect both
the inner and outer pairs to the matching pair on the other end. Sonic even
gave me a fancy Y cable, which on one end has an RJ14 plug with both lines
(inner and outer pair) active, and the other end has 2 separate RJ11 plugs
each with only the inner pair. Using this Y cable, I can plug the modem
directly into the MPOE, and connect both modem lines for bonded operation, or
test single-line operation by connecting either single line to either the
modem&rsquo;s master or slave (in practice, since slave-only operation isn&rsquo;t useful,
it&rsquo;s only useful to use the side of the Y cable that connects as the other
end&rsquo;s outer pair, thus goes to the modem&rsquo;s master side). And also, I can hack
the Y cable to work at my 2-line RJ14 jack to (in one direction) connect the
inner pair on the line to either the inner or outer pair on the modem, or (in
the other direction) connect the inner pair on the modem to either the inner
or outer pair on the line (and if you&rsquo;ve followed me so far, you&rsquo;ll see that
these 4 configurations are really just 3, and 2 of them connect only the slave
line, so the only useful one is connecting the modem&rsquo;s master line to the
inner incoming pair, and there&rsquo;s no way to test the modem&rsquo;s master line on
only the outer incoming pair, unless I build myself a cable that connects
outer pair to outer pair while not connecting the inner pair).</p>

<p>The reason I&rsquo;m complaining: this would all have been strictly better had
Comtrend made the modem treat its inner pair as the master line. As it is now,
you get the right result when connecting with a standard 2-pair phone cable to
a 2-line jack, or using the fancy Y cable to connect to 2 separate 1-line
jacks. But if you use a 1-line cable (to either a 1 or 2 line jack), or a
2-line cable to a 1-line jack, you&rsquo;ll end up in the broken configuration, and
this easily made mistake could have been easily avoided if they&rsquo;d just
configured the modem the more obvious way.</p>

<p>Why do I care so much about connecting this modem one line at a time, when
it&rsquo;s designed for bonded operation, you might ask? That&rsquo;s a story for another
time.</p>

<p>Update 4/16/2011: Sonic.net noticed this post, and called me to say that the
various problems reported here have been fixed in updates by Comtrend to both
the hardware and software. They were surprised I&rsquo;d gotten one of the old
modems, and are sending me a replacement (and even though most of the problems
mentioned in this post only affect troubleshooting and won&rsquo;t matter for real
usage, I accepted the offer to see if the newer modem will help with any of
the other problems I&rsquo;m experiencing). +1 to Sonic.net for noticing this and
being proactive.</p>

<blockquote><p>I shouldn’t have to ask this, but what is the fastest way to eject a
removable disk in Windows 7? So far I’ve been finding an explorer window, then
right clicking on the drive, and picking eject. Why is this three difficult
clicks? What’s the one thing that you know is going to happen with…</p></blockquote>

<p>I use the systray icon. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that bad. Except when it breaks…
yeah, that shouldn&rsquo;t be a concern but it is; even under Win7 I&rsquo;ve seen quite a
few occurrences where right-clicking that Unplug/Eject systray icon does
nothing. Then you have to double-click said icon, and navigate through the
resulting dialog box, which is too many clicks. Also, even when the systray
icon isn&rsquo;t broken, sometimes the autohide logic decides to hide it (and I
understand the sad state of affairs that led MS to implement autohide for
systray icons, but I don&rsquo;t think it should choose transient status icons like
this one). I just set it to always show.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not 100% with you on &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the one thing you know is going to happen
with&rdquo; removable disks. Just because it&rsquo;s connected to a bus that technically
supports hotplug doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re going to remove it. On my Mac, I have a
couple drives connected via Firewire that I never unplug, and I actively
dislike that there&rsquo;s always an eject button staring me in the face and
tempting me to press it, or waiting for errant clicks. I&rsquo;ve only ever
accidentally ejected one of these drives once, but that&rsquo;s still once too many.
And in no case should the guest user be able to eject the Time Machine drive.
(<a href="http://www.facebook.com/metamatt/posts/10150099468713843">I complained about this
before</a>;
unfortunately that was on Facebook and links from the public web won&rsquo;t work
well so apologies if you&rsquo;re reading this and can&rsquo;t see that.) And even for
disks you do unplug sometimes, the OS gets no guarantees as to when.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m fine with how Windows exposes this (though it should actually always
work). And I wish that Mac OS had a way to say &ldquo;treat this drive as
nonremovable&rdquo;, or at least require admin abilities and a confirmation dialog
before ejecting it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Given the reliability problems I&rsquo;m experiencing with <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/07/state-%0Aof-the-last-mile-internet-connection-year-2009/">my otherwise nicely fast
Comcast DOCSIS 3 connection</a>, I&rsquo;m looking for something
new. It has to be reliable, and it has to be at least competitive on speeds
for both download and upload, though I&rsquo;m willing to sacrifice some speed for
reliability and better policies.</p>

<p>The long and short of the Comcast connection: it&rsquo;s flaky (manifesting as modem
crashes. I&rsquo;ve called Comcast multiple times and they&rsquo;ve twice told me to
remove splitters, twice visited and measured the signal and said it looks good
and once replaced a poorly wired splitter; after all this the problem is less
frequent but still occurs multiple times per month.</p>

<p>So what are my other options? <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/04/07/state-of-the-last-mile-internet-%0Aconnection-year-2008/">Astound worked ok for
me</a> but is too slow (esp. for uploads); AT&amp;T&rsquo;s best is
U-verse which also has slower upload speeds and apparently isn&rsquo;t available
here anyway; other DSL options have even slower upload speeds; then there&rsquo;s
this newer indie ISP, Sonic.net, with a DSL option I haven&rsquo;t seen before.</p>

<p><a href="http://sonic.net/solutions/home/internet/fusion/">Sonic.net Fusion Broadband</a>
is intriguing: an ADSL2+ connection advertised as 20mbps/1mbps, but supporting
an optional Annex M mode where you might get can get upload speeds as high as
3mbps by sacrificing some download speed, and it allows you to bond 2 lines
together for double the speed in each direction. Even accounting for some
falloff due to distance (I&rsquo;m estimated to be about 3000 wire feet from the
central office, which should be <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r21245835-ADSLADSL2-Speeds-VS-%0ADistance">just fine for
ADSL2+</a>), it seems like dual-line Fusion should get me back in the ballpark
of 30mbps/6mbps like I have now. And from a company whose entire business is
data, not trying to tie me to legacy TV or voice business models, to boot.</p>

<p>So, provisionally, I&rsquo;m trying out Sonic: The plan was to get the lines
installed, see a nice 40mbps/2mbps connection, then see how good Annex M
actually does for upload speed (nobody will make solid predictions, so I just
have to try it for myself), and if (across 2 lines with Annex M enabled and at
my loop distance) the resulting speed is even, say, 75% of what I was getting
from Comcast (30/6mbps), consider it a keeper, due to friendlier policies and
reliability.</p>

<p>Easy in theory. In reality, signing up with Sonic was easy, but the going got
rougher right after that. Sonic doesn&rsquo;t own the wires to my house; they have
to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbundled_Network_Element">rent them from
AT&amp;T</a>; as I found
<a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/03/31%0A/state-of-the-last-mile-internet-connection-year-2001/">last time I tried indie DSL in 2001</a>, this isn&rsquo;t a perfect
recipe for success. The day they were supposed to connect the wires, AT&amp;T
showed up 7 hours late, then told me they couldn&rsquo;t do the job because it was
too late in the day and they&rsquo;d have to come back the next day. The next day,
they connected the wires, I plugged in the DSL modem from Sonic, and found
myself the proud owner of two 4mbps/1mbps DSL circuits. This wasn&rsquo;t going
exactly as planned.</p>

<p>I called Sonic; they looked at the statistics they monitor from their end of
the DSL equipment and immediately agreed this was a problem that AT&amp;T would
have to look into; they made an appointment and AT&amp;T sent someone back to my
house a few days later; the AT&amp;T tech measured a bunch of stuff, said &ldquo;looks
good to me&rdquo;, and left without anything having improved.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few weeks. Sonic seems to be going to heroic lengths to get
AT&amp;T to up the quality of the wiring, but the fact that heroic lengths are
necessary, and haven&rsquo;t succeeded after 6 weeks, is disheartening. They&rsquo;ve
managed to speed up one line and not the other, so one line syncs at
18mbps/1mbps and the other at 4mbps/1mbps. (Now that one line is behaving as
promised, it&rsquo;s also hard to believe they can&rsquo;t get the other one into shape &mdash;
before that, I was starting to think the distance to the CO was wrong and
there was another 6000 feet of wire in my loop.) In any case, I have yet to
even get to the second step of my plan, after dozens of calls to Sonic and 5
visits from AT&amp;T service technicians.</p>

<p>At this point, it continues to be a race to see who can give me fast reliable
access. I&rsquo;m continuing to try to get Sonic to get AT&amp;T to provide the promised
line quality and speeds. The more time that passes, the harder it is to remain
optimistic about this. Meanwhile Comcast seems to remain the owners of the
highest-bandwidth wires into my house, so at the same time I keep trying to
get them to fix their reliability problem, though they&rsquo;ve been charging me $30
for troubleshooting visits which didn&rsquo;t find or fix the problem, which is not
cool.</p>

<p>My current plan is still to stick with Sonic &mdash; I really want to like them &mdash;
but the difficulty of getting AT&amp;T to give me a good line (after 6 weeks and
counting) is disheartening, and even when they do get that fixed, I&rsquo;ll have to
cross my fingers and hope that Annex M works out ok. Also, the Comtrend 5361
modem Sonic sent me has now crashed 3 times even though I&rsquo;m barely using it,
and generally seems buggy (which is scary since, you&rsquo;ll recall, I only reached
this point because of cable modem crashes). And worse, the reported 22mbps
speed I&rsquo;ve reached so far is just the sync speed reported by the modem &mdash;
actual usable transfer speeds to any site I&rsquo;ve tried top out around 7mbps
down, which I suspect might also be a bug in the modem firmware when bonding
lines of different speeds (maybe it won&rsquo;t shove any more data over the fast
line than the slow line). If once the lines are the same speed, usable speed
remains only 1/3 of nominal sync speed, I&rsquo;ll be sorely disappointed.</p>

<p>So. Maybe all these problems will be resolved and I&rsquo;ll get a reliable modem
that syncs at 30+/5+ and actually delivers that as usable speed. And maybe
I&rsquo;ll have to consider other options.</p>

<p>Backup plan 1: Get Comcast to fix the crashtastic-cable-modem problem. I&rsquo;m
losing hope in that, too, after multiple service visits, all they want to do
is yank on wires, and that hasn&rsquo;t fixed it; also their monitoring is poor (I
called in while modem was down and they say they have no record of outages and
I say what about right now?); also I filled out a survey about customer
service and got a phone call from a manager saying &ldquo;ok I see you&rsquo;ve been
having this problem for a while, we&rsquo;ll make sure to send you the good tech
guy&rdquo; and the next tech guy they sent did seem better but still didn&rsquo;t fix it.</p>

<p>Backup plan 2: Maybe Comcast&rsquo;s
<a href="http://business.comcast.com/internet/plans.aspx">business</a>
<a href="http://business.comcast.com/enterprise/Index/Services/teleworker">options</a>
have better tech support, troubleshooting abilities, or reliability
guarantees. A business-class line of my own costs a lot more than what I&rsquo;m
paying now; the teleworker plan is actually cheaper but relies on support from
my employer, which may or may not exist.</p>

<p>Backup plan 3: Stick with Comcast, but route around the crashtastic modem:
install a USB-controlled kill switch/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STONITH">STONITH
device</a>, connect that to my router, and
teach the router to reboot the cable modem when necessary.</p>

<p>Backup plan 4: A low-tech version of #3; run a pull cord toggle switch (like
those used for lamps), controlling the cable modem&rsquo;s power line, from the
modem&rsquo;s home in my server closet up through the furnace duct to my office.</p>

<p>Backup plan 5: Hmm, I wonder how much <a href="http://fastmetrics.com/metricfiber_diagram.htm">fiber from
fastmetrics</a> would actually
cost. Way too much, I&rsquo;m sure. But still.</p>

<p>Right. Remind me again why Silicon Valley and the Bay Area as a whole doesn&rsquo;t
have FiOS or anything comparable? (There are a few trial areas in Palo Alto
and Sebastopol with FTTH in small areas, but no wide scale deployments.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure there&rsquo;s a market for it here.</p>
