  <div class="entry-content"><p>Vanessa and I wanted to take a real destination trip with Dominic, kinda sorta
just to see if we could do it. Not that we were hoping or envisioning that it
would be impossible, but it was hard to visualize, so we had to try.</p>

<p>We settled on Ireland as the destination based on two propositions: we can
take the baby to the pub, and the people love babies. (These were the actual
reasons recommended by an Irish friend of Vanessa.) OK, not that we&#8217;re such
raging alcoholics that we can only travel to pubs, but &#8220;can take the baby to
the pub&#8221; is actually a pretty good proxy for &#8220;is not uptight, and will be
forgiving of people traveling with a baby&#8221;, which turned out to be true. Also
true is that the Irish were not only gracious and charming hosts, but that
many of them indeed like babies and know how to show it. For us, this
translated to both people being prepared and understanding, but also to a lot
of free entertainment. Dominic likes a lot of stimulation, and he got it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty proud of our itinerary, in retrospect, because we were making it up
as we went along and it turned out really easy. No doubt it helps that Ireland
is a small country, native English speaking (almost), and the people and
culture are easygoing, so probably anything you do there is likely to go well.
Still, for us it turned out remarkably easy to travel.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s where we went:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67861147@N00/8219093821"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8482/8219093821_5003d3ab9%0A0.jpg" alt="Ireland travel map" /></a></p>

<p>The itinerary, of which I&#8217;m proud because the transfers were so easy and
involved only public transit: We flew from San Francisco to London and then
immediately to Dublin and caught the city bus to our hotel. Dublin: 3 days
walking around, with a side DART trip to Howth. Then we walked from our hotel
to Heuston Station and caught the Irish Rail train to Galway, where we stayed
at a hotel a block away from the train station. Galway: 2 days walking around,
with a bus/boat trip to Inishmore (largest of the Arran Islands). Then we
rented a car from the Budget office right next to the train station and drove
south to the Cliffs of Moher, with an overnight stay at Ennis, then to Dingle.
Dingle: 2 days walking around, with a drive around the peninsula loop. Then we
drove onwards to the Kerry Peninsula and around the Ring of Kerry, then to
Kenmare. Kenmare: 2 days walking around including a hilly and marshy segment
of the Kerry Way. Finally, leaving Kenmare, we drove past Cork to Waterford,
dropped our rental car off at the tiny airport there, and caught a flight back
to London Luton, from where it was an easy train ride to the London
neighborhood we were staying in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One more post on the topic of PG&amp;E bills for solar (NEM) customers.</p>

<p>PGE&#8217;s NEM billing scheme <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2012/11/09/one-year-of-solar-power/">blends usage across
seasons</a> to
allow for seasonal variation in generated power, and their E-6 billing scheme
<a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2012/11/11/e-1-vs-e-6-for-residential-%0Asolar-customers/">separates usage into 5 time-of-use
periods</a> to encourage customers to shift usage away from peak
periods.</p>

<p>A question that just occurred to me is whether you can game their billing
results by time-shifting usage around inside the same true-up period, between
TOU zones, months, or even seasons.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy to move usage between TOU zones of the same day (say between
summer on-peak and summer off-peak) by delaying energy-hungry activities like
baking pies until night; that&#8217;s both tractable for a home customer and exactly
the kind of behavior the E-6 TOU billing rates are designed to encourage.
Moving usage between TOU zones of different seasons (say between summer on-
peak and winter off-peak), or even from one monthly billing cycle to another,
would be more difficult (it&#8217;s possible in theory but doesn&#8217;t really match
human activity patterns to delay all your energy-hungry activities for months
and then execute them in a big batch months later; alternatively you&#8217;d need a
really big battery which is exactly what grid tie-in lets you avoid), but I&#8217;m
still curious if it would be advantageous in some circumstances.</p>

<p>Again drawing on the example of my last year&#8217;s experience, the answer turns
out to be yes for both forms of time-shifting. Say you&#8217;re going to bake a
bunch of pies, and need to run the oven at 3KW for a little over 3 hours,
consuming 10 KWh of electricity. (The 3 KW figure is realistic for an electric
oven; the heating element running continuously is not; ignore that in the
service of an example.) If you&#8217;re going to consume that 10 KWh, does it matter
<em>when</em> you consume it; what&#8217;s the effect on your final true-up bill of adding
10 KWh at various different times?</p>

<p>If you can move that 10 KWh from a higher-value TOU period to a lower-value
TOU period in the same day, you win; this turns out to be independent of
tiering, consumption, or which month or season you&#8217;re in, which is a nice
property. It won&#8217;t change your overall consumption for that day or month, so
it won&#8217;t change your tiering calculation. If you had a surplus in the higher-
value TOU period, you&#8217;ll now have a bigger surplus, which at the higher rate
is more than enough to buy the same electricity back from PG&amp;E later in the
day, even if the solar cells aren&#8217;t producing at that time. (Basically, it
wasn&#8217;t immediately obvious to me what the credit/charge calculations do in
this case, because my intuition keeps wanting to tell me it&#8217;s better to
consume energy when I&#8217;m getting it free from my solar panels than when I&#8217;m
buying it from PG&amp;E. That turns out not to be true; the NEM system means if
you buy and sell the same amount of electricity at a given rate, it&#8217;s a wash,
and the TOU system actually rewards you for selling it at a higher rate and
buying it back at a lower rate.) So yes, you can &#8220;game&#8221; the E-6 billing system
by moving usage from peak times to off-peak times, which use of &#8220;game&#8221; gets
scare quotes because it&#8217;s actually the behavior they want to encourage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, if you could move that same 10 KWh across months, the story is a
lot more complicated. Due to tiering, you may be paying more than the baseline
rate for some of your electricity, and since PG&amp;E applies the tiering
calculations entirely inside each month, based on that month&#8217;s usage, you can
actually get crossover between &#8220;high-value&#8221; and &#8220;low-value&#8221; TOU periods. More
concretely: as a solar generator, you may be paying more for winter off-peak
electricity at 3rd-tier rates than you are for summer part-peak electricity
where you never exceed the first tier. This is exactly what happened to me
over the last year (note in the <a href="http://www.pge.com/tariffs/tm2/pdf/ELEC_SCHEDS_E-6.pdf">E-6
schedule</a> that winter
off-peak and part-peak above 130% of baseline cost about what summer on-peak
baseline usage does, and winter off-peak and part-peak above 200% of baseline
cost more than the summer on-peak baseline). While from the previous example
you&#8217;d expect the result of time-shifting your usage to depend on the TOU rates
(and you would win by shifting from a high-rate TOU to a low-rate TOU, and
lose by doing the reverse), in fact it also depends on the tiering
calculations, and you can also win by shifting usage out of a month where you
had higher-tier usage into a month where you didn&#8217;t, and this can even be true
if it involves shifting that usage from a low-rate TOU to a higher-rate TOU.
So, surprisingly, you could see a net benefit from moving usage from winter to
summer; it&#8217;s pretty easy to make the numbers work out if moving from winter
part-peak to summer part-peak, and in extreme cases, you could even win by
moving from winter off-peak to summer on-peak. This is decidedly not the
result they want to encourage, so I&#8217;d call it gaming the system. (Of course,
you&#8217;d need a way to actually buffer your usage across months; a better way to
lower your winter bills is to simply use less electricity, without
compensating in the opposite direction in the summer.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll note again that this perverse result derives from the fact that PG&amp;E
calculates and finalizes the tiering calculations entirely inside each month,
instead of smoothing them across the true-up period, so it&#8217;s actually possible
for a big energy user with an even bigger solar array to generate a net
surplus for the year but be paying 4th-tier rates for winter electricity when
the array is underperforming.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a follow-on to my <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2012/11/09/one-year-of-solar-power/">article on understanding the PG&amp;E NEM
bill</a>, I
decided to go back and recalculate our usage charges for the normal E-1
billing schedule, in addition to the E-6 I&#8217;m actually using.</p>

<p>I also threw in the calculation for the E-1 value of the electricity we
generated instead of buying from PG&amp;E, that is, how much we would have spent
to buy all the electricity we used from PG&amp;E if we hadn&#8217;t installed the solar
array.</p>

<p>In short, E-6 was a solid win for us: a usage charge of $64.54 would have been
$275.10 with E-11.</p>

<p>The results:</p>

<p>E-6 was a solid win for us. In the 6 winter months where we had a usage
charge, the usage charge was about $10/month higher with E-12. In the 6 summer
months where we had a usage credit, the usage credit was about $30/month lower
with E-13.</p>

<p>On the flip side, E-6 has a &#8220;meter charge&#8221; of approximately 25 cents per day,
or $92 per year4, which E-1 does not. So our true E-6 cost (for electrical
usage, plus the privilege of E-6 TOU billing) is $156.88 for the year, and
E-1&#8217;s true cost remains at $275.10.</p>

<p>It seems like E-6 would be an easy win for anyone who can generate all of
their summer on-peak electricity, or especially all of their summer on-peak
and summer partial-peak electricity. (You can compare the exact prices in the
E-1 and E-6 billing schedules, but the E-6 off-peak rates and winter part-peak
rates are lower than E-1 rates; E-6 summer part-peak rates are a little higher
than E-1 rates; E-6 summer on-peak rates are a lot higher than E-1 rates.)</p>

<p>I also remember being told that PG&amp;E will let you switch from E-1 to E-6 and
then at the end of the first year, if you didn&#8217;t save money, you can take a
mulligan and retroactively undo the switch and pay the E-1 rate. I can&#8217;t find
confirmation of that on PG&amp;E&#8217;s website today, though.</p>

<hr />

<ol>
<li><p>You may notice that my earlier article lists our usage charge for the year as $60.22 and here it&#8217;s $64.54; the difference is that $60.22 is PG&amp;E&#8217;s number and $64.54 is my calculation for what it should be (and I had to fudge the numbers for October 2011 where PG&amp;E switched me from the old plan to NEM midway through the billing cycle, plus we may round differently, plus there may be other errors in my calculations). This seemed close enough to go through the rest of the exercise, and the technique used to calculate this number is the same one I&#8217;ll use for the E-1 number, so this seemed like the one to use for this comparison. ↩</p></li>
<li><p>E-6 is always a win in the winter, because there&#8217;s no winter peak zone; winter part-peak and winter off-peak are both cheaper than the E-1 rate. And between the solar array and our usage patterns, the vast majority of our PG&amp;E usage was in the off-peak time anyway. ↩</p></li>
<li><p>Between the solar array and our usage patterns, we ran a surplus in summer on-peak and summer part-peak for nearly the entire summer, and had to buy summer electricity only off-peak. This is exactly the behavior that E-6 is designed to encourage, and it rewarded us correspondingly. ↩</p></li>
<li><p>So if you want a true zero bill from E-6, you need to generate enough of a surplus that it would counterbalance this $92/year &#8220;meter charge&#8221;. That would take 495 KWh of summer on-peak surplus or 1028 KWh of summer part-peak surplus, paid out at the &#8220;generation&#8221; rate due to the NSC rules. ↩</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I got solar panels installed on the roof of our house last fall, friends
immediately started asking how well they were working out, and my answer had
to be that while they&#8217;re <a href="https://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/public/systems/g8ah32261">generating a nice amount of
power</a>, I
wouldn&#8217;t know how well they were doing on the actual goal of zeroing our
electric bill until a year had passed. That year has now passed, and it&#8217;s time
to answer the question.</p>

<p>If you add solar power to your grid energy, at least the way it&#8217;s done in
California, two things will happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your electric bills will be lower, but</li>
<li>You won&#8217;t understand them.</li>
</ol>


<h2>The problem:</h2>

<p>California electric rates are confusing because they&#8217;re complicated and
variable. You pay a different rate depending on how much you use (tiering)1.
You can opt into time-of-use (TOU) billing2, which makes electricity more
expensive at peak times and cheaper the rest of the time to encourage you to
shift usage away from peak times. The normal residential billing schedule is
called <a href="http://www.pge.com/tariffs/tm2/pdf/ELEC_SCHEDS_E-1.pdf">E-1 (&#8220;residential
services&#8221;)</a> and shows
5 different rates according to tier; the TOU residential schedule is called
<a href="http://www.pge.com/tariffs/tm2/pdf/ELEC_SCHEDS_E-6.pdf">E-6 (&#8220;residential time-of-use
service&#8221;)</a> and shows
25 different rates according to tier and time.</p>

<p>Once you introduce solar (or other generation capabilities) into the mix,
there&#8217;s another wrinkle. Assuming you stay connected to the grid, PG&amp;E will
convert your billing to what they call <a href="http://www.pge.com/standardnem/">NEM</a>
(Net Energy Metering), which means your electric meter will measure the flow
of power in both directions — from the grid into your house when you&#8217;re using
more than you&#8217;re generating, and from your house back to the grid when you&#8217;re
generating more than you&#8217;re using. But solar panel output varies by season and
with weather, in addition to the obvious day/night cycle. To account for this
seasonal variation, PG&amp;E bills NEM customers on a yearly cycle called the
<a href="http://www.pge.com/myhome/myaccount/explanationofbill/nem/">true-up period</a>.
Your monthly bills are only an approximation, and at the end of the year they
calculate the actual balance owed compared to what you already paid, and have
you &#8220;true up&#8221; to that amount, hence the name.</p>

<p>For NEM customers, that&#8217;s 3 different axes of variation3: tiered rates based
on total consumption, variable rates due to time-of-use, and true-up billing
to account for seasonal variation of generated output.</p>

<h2>Before adding solar generation</h2>

<p>You have to calculate how much electricity you want to generate to produce the
desired effect (economically or ecologically or both4), and then you need to
calculate the size of a PV solar array that will produce that effect.</p>

<p>Both of these calculations actually turn out to involve a fair amount of
prediction. Companies that specialize in solar installations (for example,
<a href="http://www.luminalt.com/meet-luminalt/about-us">Luminalt</a>, who installed
ours) can help you with these predictions and calculations.</p>

<p>But even after you&#8217;ve done the calculations, decided to go solar, and had the
array installed and it&#8217;s live, you still won&#8217;t know if you were right, at
least for a while. That&#8217;s what this post is about. I wanted to know if we&#8217;d
predicted correctly, and I also wanted to know if PG&amp;E&#8217;s billing methods
fairly account for the seasonal variation. (If I have a large surplus in
summer on-peak in July, and a big deficit in winter off-peak in January, do
these cancel out, and how?)</p>

<h2>After adding solar generation</h2>

<p>I said that after activating a solar array and switching over to PG&amp;E&#8217;s NEM
program, you&#8217;ll get lower bills that you won&#8217;t understand. Here&#8217;s what I mean.
Each month with my electric bill5, I get a separate &#8220;Net energy metering
electric statement&#8221;. It includes three amounts:</p>

<ol>
<li>&#8220;total current month&#8217;s billed amount&#8221;, which is always in the neighborhood of $12.</li>
<li>&#8220;current month energy charge or credit&#8221;, which is the actual charge for electricity I used, or credit for electricity I produced, after accounting for tiered TOU rates.</li>
<li>&#8220;cumulative energy charges or credits for the current true-up period&#8221;, which is the sum of the #2 values.</li>
</ol>


<p>This is hard to interpret month by month, partly because there&#8217;s no
relationship between what I&#8217;m asked to pay (#1) and what I used (#2), and #3
will swing wildly one direction6 and then correct over the course of the year.
All of this evens out at the end of the year, which is the reason for the
1-year true-up method of billing.</p>

<p>But when the 1-year anniversary arrives, and with it the final true-up
payment, there&#8217;s a new confusing quantity: &#8220;total current month&#8217;s billed
amount&#8221; is replaced with &#8220;total true-up billed amount&#8221;. This amount, which is
your actual bill for the 12th month, is not the usual $12, bears no obvious
relationship to the cumulative energy charge, and isn&#8217;t explained or derived
by PG&amp;E on the bill or elsewhere that I could find7. (In my case: my
cumulative energy charge after 12 months was $60.22, and the &#8220;total true-up
billed amount&#8221; was $22.02.) Why?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a method to their madness, but I had to dig deep into PG&amp;E&#8217;s rate
documentation and then spend a few hours messing with a spreadsheet to try to
derive the calculations that would map my usage to my bills.</p>

<h2>Understanding true-up billing</h2>

<p>First, the monthly bill. Where does this $12 come from? It turns out PG&amp;E
charges E-6 (TOU) customers a &#8220;meter charge&#8221; of approximately $0.25 per day.
E6 and E-1 both also have a &#8220;minimum charge&#8221; of approximately $0.15 per day;
they don&#8217;t explain what this means, but if my reverse engineering of my bills
is correct, for NEM customers it&#8217;s essentially a placeholder for your usage
before they know what your usage is. These fees added together and multiplied
by the number of days in a billing cycle yield the approximately $12 amount
that I was billed for each month (billing cycles ranged from 28 to 32 days, so
the monthly bill ranged from $11.22 to $12.83, with the most common bill being
$12.02 for a 30-day billing cycle).</p>

<p>Second, the usage charges. These are not simple (since they involve both the
tiering and TOU calculations), but they are actually decently explained on the
monthly NEM statement itself, and with one nitpicky exception8, they&#8217;re the
same as what you had before you added NEM, and the true-up calculation doesn&#8217;t
affect them.</p>

<p>Third, the cumulative usage charge. This one is completely straightforward:
add the usage charges for the current true-up period, to date. Each NEM
statement shows the current cumulative charge (this amount) and the amount by
which it changed (the month&#8217;s usage charge), and you can verify that the
current cumulative balance is equal to the previous month&#8217;s balance plus/minus
the current month&#8217;s usage charge/credit. However, as mentioned above, this
amount will swing one direction and then correct due to seasonal variation,</p>

<p>Fourth, the true-up amount. This is a simple calculation if you know where it
comes from, but PG&amp;E doesn&#8217;t explain it, so I had to reverse engineer it,
learning to understand the daily meter and minimum charges. What it boils down
to is that the $0.15 &#8220;minimum charge&#8221; is not a real charge once the true-up
period is over, but a provisional placeholder: you pay this with each month&#8217;s
$12 bill, but at the end of the year, when your real usage is known, you get
back the provisional amount and pay the real amount. At the end of the year,
you take your usage charge/credit, and add the meter charge ($0.25 per day or
about $7.50 per monthly bill or $92.33 in a full year9), and that&#8217;s what you
owe for the year. Except you&#8217;ve already paid that meter charge, plus you&#8217;ve
paid the &#8220;minimum&#8221; usage charge as a provisional placeholder. So subtract the
provisional usage charge ($0.15 per day or about $4.50 per monthly bill or
$53.96 in a full year), and you have the amount that&#8217;s unpaid, that you must
still pay in order to True Up. So, your first 11 bills are for 30-ish days of
meter charges and minimum charges, totaling about $12; your 12th bill is for
30-ish days of meter charges, minus 335-ish days of minimum charges, plus your
cumulative usage charge for the whole year. In my case, actual usage at the
end of the year was $60.22, of which $46.27 had already been paid monthly as
that &#8220;minimum&#8221; charge, so what I&#8217;d call the actual true-up component was
$13.95; add in $8.07 in meter fees (32 days at $0.25/day) for the final
billing period and we have what PG&amp;E calls my true-up bill of $22.02.</p>

<h2>Cancelation across TOU periods</h2>

<p>I was curious whether a surplus in one TOU period (for example, summer on-
peak, which is likely the best case for residential solar customers) can
partially or wholly cancel a deficit in another TOU period (for example,
winter off-peak, which is pretty much entirely dark, and thus worst-case for
solar customers). As it turns out, PG&amp;E doesn&#8217;t directly add and subtract
usage across TOU periods; they convert usage to a dollar amount every month
(based on TOU periods and tiering), then add and subtract the monthly dollar
amounts. This is a clever way of accounting, since it&#8217;s pretty easy to
understand, and does a pretty fair job of reconciling the amounts from
different TOU periods. (In fact, it works out pretty well for residential
solar customers, since your summer on-peak surplus is credited at a higher
rate than that winter off-peak deficit.) My only complaint here is again that
the tiering calculations are done per month and only affect you on the
downside.</p>

<h2>Raw facts</h2>

<p>Here are the actual numbers from my house over the last year, which may be
helpful in understanding the derivations here, making the descriptions more
concrete, and/or planning your own PV solar system.</p>

<ul>
<li>Generated by solar: 7195 KWh</li>
<li>Bought from PG&amp;E: 1601 KWh</li>
<li>Total consumed: 8796 KWh</li>
<li>Months with positive grid usage, resulting in PGE charge: 6 (Oct-Mar)</li>
<li>Months with negative grid usage, resulting in PG&amp;E credit: 6 (Apr-Sept)</li>
<li>Whole-year usage charge: $60.22</li>
<li>Value of electricity consumed if I had to buy it all from PG&amp;E: $2052.34 (assuming E-1 and not E-6 billing, since I don&#8217;t have the generated KWh broken out by TOU period)</li>
<li>Prior-year electric bill: $1403.77</li>
<li>Granular usage (from PG&amp;E&#8217;s point of view), broken down by month and TOU billing period:</li>
</ul>


<h2>Sum-up</h2>

<p>The true-up billing method mostly but not entirely allows you to smooth out
the seasonal variation, canceling bad performance one month against good
performance in another month.</p>

<p>You can understand your monthly bills if you think of them like this: $12 a
month, $7.50 of which is just for the privilege of being connected to the
grid, and $4.50 of which is a deposit against your actual usage. Meanwhile,
the actual usage bill accrues in the background, and at the end of the year,
you pay this balance minus a $49.50 refund for those eleven $4.50 deposits.</p>

<p>Due to the low NCS reimbursement it still seems to me that the optimal array
size is what brings you very close to even for the year, offsetting your usage
without generating much of a surplus. However, due to the way usage tiers are
finalized each month instead of across the true-up period, sizing your array
slightly larger than this may pay off by reducing higher-tier winter bills,
even though the net surplus KWh aren&#8217;t themselves valuable in the NCS
calculation.</p>

<hr />

<ol>
<li><p>The baseline usage, which determines the details of the tiering calculation, further varies by where you live in California and whether your home has a gas or electric primary heat source. ↩</p></li>
<li><p>You can opt into TOU billing regardless of whether you have solar or other generation facilities, but in general, it makes a lot of sense if you have generation capabilities and less sense if you don&#8217;t, plus most people not planning on adding solar won&#8217;t have the TOU option waved in their face and probably don&#8217;t even know about it. I don&#8217;t know the exact numbers, but I presume most NEM customers opt for TOU billing, and most grid-only customers do not. ↩</p></li>
<li><p>There&#8217;s another confusing way they split things up, but I&#8217;m not denoting it as an axis because it&#8217;s not orthogonal to the others. PG&amp;E separates the rate into separate quantities for &#8220;generation&#8221;, &#8220;transmission&#8221;, &#8220;distribution&#8221;, and &#8220;the funding of public purpose programs&#8221;. We&#8217;ll come back to the reason for this bookkeeping sleight-of-hand later; it doesn&#8217;t really matter unless you generate a surplus, but if you do, look for this to raise its head in the Net Surplus Compensation calculation. ↩</p></li>
<li><p>If you believe solar power is cleaner than grid power, the ecologically optimal size for your home array is &#8220;as large as possible&#8221;, though of course there&#8217;s some ecological cost to PV panel manufacturing too. But if you&#8217;re trying to make your solar array economically viable, you&#8217;ll want to compare actual costs and benefits; the costs depend on the cost and output of the array and how long you plan to keep it and whether you buy or lease and the details of the financing, all things you can find <a href="http://www.gosolarnow.com/NetMetering.html">companies or calculators</a> to help with. The benefits depend on what you&#8217;re actually paying for grid electricity, which follows the complicated calculations already described. If you&#8217;re a light user paying baseline $0.12/KWh rates, you&#8217;ll save less than a heavy user paying 4th-tier $0.34/KWh rates. While the specifics vary, it&#8217;s probably easy to generate solar power for less than $0.34/KWh and somewhat hard to generate solar power for less than $0.12/KWh. What this means is most solar customers try to offset most but not all of their own usage, to get back down in the baseline tier. It&#8217;s often not cost-effective to compete with PG&amp;E&#8217;s baseline rates. It&#8217;s especially cost-ineffective to operate at a net surplus, because of the way PG&amp;E values the surplus: read their <a href="http://www.pge.com/myhome/saveenergymoney/solarenergy/afterinstalling/ab920/">Net Surplus Compensation</a> rules, paying special attention to the last section, &#8220;Why is NSC less than the credit on my NEM statement?&#8221;. In short, PG&amp;E splits the &#8220;retail&#8221; rates that you&#8217;re used to seeing into separate components for generation, transmission, distribution, and the funding of public programs like nuclear plant decommissioning; your NEM credits come back at the retail rate until you hit break-even; however if you operate at a surplus, PG&amp;E pays only a &#8220;wholesale-type rate for generation&#8221;. You can see the actual breakdown on the E-1 or E-6 billing schedules; I don&#8217;t actually know how to calculate the breakdown for E-6 since your surplus is for the year and it&#8217;s not clear which TOU rate to apply; in any case generation is less than half of the total. ↩</p></li>
<li><p>Actually not <em>with</em> my electric bill, because I&#8217;ve opted for paperless billing and told PG&amp;E to stop sending me paperless bills, and I can look at the details on the website. But none of the NEM details are available on their website, nor is there an option to go paperless for the NEM data. So what actually happens is the NEM data shows up on paper in my mailbox a few days after I get the bill itself electronically. ↩</p></li>
<li><p>Which direction it swings will depend on when your true-up period starts. Mine starts in October and so the first few months are fall and winter, and I accumulated quite a large charge before April when I started getting credits. By the following October, it was nearly back to 0. If your true-up period starts in April, you&#8217;d presumably see the reverse, amassing a series of credits and a large negative balance over the summer before winter charges start to eat away at the credit balance. ↩</p></li>
<li><p>PG&amp;E&#8217;s explanation of how to read this is split into four pages on their website, for the <a href="http://www.pge.com/myhome/myaccount/explanationofbill/nem/">monthly statement</a>, <a href="http://www.pge.com/myhome/myaccount/explanationofbill/nem/monthlybill/">monthly bill</a>, <a href="http://www.pge.com/myhome/myaccount/explanationofbill/nem/trueupstatement/">true-up-statement</a>, and <a href="http://www.pge.com/myhome/myaccount/explanationofbill/nem/trueupstatement/">true-up bill</a>. These pages explain the meaning of each item on the bill, but don&#8217;t explain how the amounts are calculated, or why you owe what you owe. ↩</p></li>
<li><p>The true-up calculation doesn&#8217;t affect the monthly usage charge calculation, but arguably it should, because the rates depend on tiering, the tiering depends on usage, and usage is supposed to be smoothed over the entire true-up period. But actually, the tiering calculations are done entirely inside each month. What this means is that in the winter when your solar array is underperforming, higher usage might push you into the upper tiers, and you&#8217;ll pay more for your grid electricity because of this, and no amount of summer credits can offset these higher rates. Again using my first-year numbers as an example, my assigned baseline value for the year sums to 2878 units, and my actual cumulative usage was 1601 KWh. (Or: the average of the monthly baselines was 240, and my average monthly usage was 133.) I&#8217;d argue that this means I should be paying only first-tier rates. However, because of the seasonal variation expected with solar generation, my usage from PG&amp;E&#8217;s point of view is skewed heavily toward winter, and in fact I had above-baseline usage in only the 4 shortest months: November through February. Because PG&amp;E applies the baseline-to-tier calculation on each month&#8217;s usage individually, instead of across the true-up period, I paid substantially more for electricity in those 4 months. In my case, I was charged $60.22 for my electricity usage, but if it had all been at baseline rates, I would have been owed a $5 credit. ↩</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;m writing this after my first year of NEM, and the PGE switched me over to NEM billing in the middle of a billing month without changing the billing cycle, so my first month&#8217;s NEM bill only included 9 days, and so my first true-up period of 12 bills is only 11 1/3 months or 345 days. Presumably, future true-up periods will be a full year. ↩</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are the stats on my cellular data usage over one year on Sprint&#8217;s
network1. (I got the phone on Halloween of 2011, and took this screenshot on
Halloween of 2012.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67861147@N00/8163380863"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7120/816338086%0A3_21996345ca.jpg" alt="1 year of cellular data usage" /></a></p>

<p>7 GB down and 1 GB up; 8 GB total; that averages to 666 MB per month. Clearly
I&#8217;m not a heavy cellular data user and not making the most out of Sprint&#8217;s
unlimited data allotment; this would fit comfortably within the other
carriers&#8217; smallest real2 data plans (1GB/month).</p>

<p>Speaking of unlimited data plans: this might sound heretical to some, but I
really wouldn&#8217;t mind metered data at a fair price. Say a penny a megabyte,
billing you only for what you use. That comes out to $10 per gigabyte, which
is actually the marginal rate that AT&amp;T and Verizon are charging now anyway,
except first they make you pay a minimum $30/month commitment and then they
round up to the next gigabyte.</p>

<p>Of course, I also wouldn&#8217;t mind an unlimited plan that was cheap and fast and
allowed tethering3.</p>

<p>In the meantime, here in the US we have Sprint offering unlimited data at a
price that&#8217;s fair for heavy users but not especially cheap for light users,
and their network isn&#8217;t the fastest and they have surcharge for tethering.
Then we have AT&amp;T and Verizon saying unlimited plans don&#8217;t incent them to
invest in their networks so they&#8217;ve moved to metered plans; on the plus side
their networks have gotten markedly faster and they don&#8217;t charge extra for
tethering on the metered plans; however their metering methods don&#8217;t meet my
definition of fair.</p>

<hr />

<ol>
<li><p>Actually 11 1/2 months on Sprint&#8217;s network, and 10 days on O2 Ireland and 3 days on Three UK during a trip to Europe. Both of their data networks, but especially Three&#8217;s, were better than what I&#8217;m accustomed to in the US; ↩</p></li>
<li><p>Ignoring AT&amp;T&#8217;s toy 250 MB/month plan. ↩</p></li>
<li><p>Which actually exists in much of the world, but not in the US. ↩</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve updated my <a href="http://www.maddogsw.com/evernote-utilities/evernote-palm-importer/">utility for importing notes from Palm Desktop into
Evernote</a>
again.</p>

<p>The big change is that it now uses <a href="http://dev.evernote.com/documentation/cloud/chapters/Authentication.ph%0Ap">OAuth for authentication to the Evernote s
ervice</a>, instead of asking you for Evernote account credentials directly. This is a
step forward in general; utilities like this one shouldn&#8217;t have unrestricted
access to your entire account, nor should they know your actual password in
case you use the same password for other services1. <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/tech/2012/11/01/third-party-authentication-%0Atransition-to-oauth-complete/">Evernote has disabled
username/password logins for third party
apps</a> to force them to use OAuth, a move which I
think more services should make2.</p>

<p>I also made some smaller changes to further improve the chance of success for
people outside the USA, using nondefault character encoding or locale
settings.</p>

<p>Finally, I added the <a href="https://github.com/metamatt%0A/evernote-palmimport">public source repository</a> to my github account. (I&#8217;ve always made the source code
for the current version available, but now the complete repository with

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I worked on my high school paper, I spent many hours working on the
newsroom Macs, but I had a Windows machine at home, and I was pretty
comfortable going back and forth. I noticed a few people who had more trouble:
Windows users who would swear a Mac would crash as soon as they touched it,
and symmetrically, Mac users who if using a Windows machine would crash it
right away.</p>

<p>This was in the bad old days of Windows 3.1 and System 7, before MMUs and
memory protection, and crashing neither OS was particularly hard or uncommon.
Still, there seemed to be something to this cross-platform-and-crash
phenomenon. A friend and I came up with a half-serious theory that these
crashes had to do with natural rhythms of human-user activity — mouse and
keyboard input would arrive and trigger interrupts and Mac OS and Windows
might have different preferences for the intervals between these interrupts
where certain rhythms would trigger race conditions just so, and kaboom, while
other rhythms would dance around the same bugs without triggering them. And,
the theory went, people would subconsciously learn what sequences of inputs
would crash their computer, learn to avoid those patterns, and compute along
happily on whichever platform they&#8217;d learned to get along with: then upon
trying the other platform, kaboom again.</p>

<p>It was with this in mind that I read <a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/2012/10/surface-impressions/">John Moltz&#8217;s impressions of Microsoft
Surface</a>. He&#8217;s
generally pretty fair about giving it a chance, but then he dings it for
screen-rotation flakiness:</p>

<blockquote><p>Once when I set it down the screen orientation was upside down and it didn’t
seem to realize it. I had to pick it up and turn it over and then back again
to get it the right way.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m sure that happened, but hey, every Apple device with automatic rotation
(iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad) I&#8217;ve ever owned occasionally does that too. Come to
think of it, so do the various digital cameras I&#8217;ve owned (from Canon, Nikon
and Panasonic). I can&#8217;t think of anything that has a similar feature that I
haven&#8217;t seen flake out that way.</p>

<p>But maybe if I could just learn to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=holding+it+wrong">hold it
right</a>…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Vanessa and I went on a weekend trip to Orange County with Dominic and wanted
to relax by watching a movie when he was napping, and the easiest vehicle for
this seemed to be our iPad. What could go wrong? Lots, it turns out.</p>

<p>I cruised over to the increasingly inaccurately named iTunes store and found
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1862079/">Safety Not Guaranteed</a> which looked
interesting so clicked Buy, waited for it to start downloading, watched the
progress bar long enough to verify it looked like it would take about 40
minutes to download, and took Dominic out for a walk so he&#8217;d fall asleep, with
the idea that in 40 minutes we&#8217;d have a sleeping baby and a watchable movie.</p>

<p>Dominic behaved as I&#8217;d hoped; the iPad didn&#8217;t; after about an hour I grabbed
the iPad to find absolutely no sign of the movie. The Videos app said &#8220;no
videos, but you can cruise over to the store to buy one&#8221;. The iTunes store app
didn&#8217;t have any downloads in progress, and going back to the Purchases tab, it
had the cloud icon next to our movie. Upon clicking that, it told me it can&#8217;t
download it because there&#8217;s not enough storage available.</p>

<p>So apparently when I first purchased the movie, there was enough storage to
download it, but then something went wrong with the download, it silently
canceled the download without showing me any error message whatsoever, and now
there&#8217;s not enough space for it? That&#8217;s hard to explain, but whatever, there&#8217;s
nothing to do but try to clear space and download it again. I go to Settings:
General: Usage and look at the breakdown of what&#8217;s using how much space, and
the individual app usage doesn&#8217;t add up to anywhere close to what it says is
used, but I don&#8217;t have many options here. So I deleted Infinity Blade to free
up a gigabyte, invoked the download, and waited another 40 minutes while it
downloaded the movie again. At the end of the download, the iPad spent another
5 minutes saying &#8220;processing&#8221;, then gave me a generic error message, and
kicked me back to the state where the movie is not available for playback but
is available for download. And again trying to download it says there&#8217;s no
space available, and going back to Settings: General: Usage, there&#8217;s 2.7GB
(the size of the movie) less than there had been when I started the download.
Something very weird is going on. I can&#8217;t fix this problem on the iPad itself
(so much for the post-PC era: you need a PC to configure or troubleshoot your
post-PC device!) and now it&#8217;s been 2 hours and we don&#8217;t have time to watch a
movie anyway.</p>

<p>When I got back home from the trip, I plugged the iPad into my Mac and
launched iTunes and iTunes told me that there&#8217;s 10GB of &#8220;other&#8221; content. Given
that this is the 16GB model (whose actual capacity is 13.8GB; go figure), that
doesn&#8217;t leave room for very many 2.7GB movie downloads. That also explains why
the total usage was so much higher than the sum of the space used by each app.
But it doesn&#8217;t at all help explain what &#8220;other&#8221; actually means; <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=itunes+capacity+other">the Internet
isn&#8217;t much help here
either</a>. Trying to get
this to go away or at least explain itself, I tried syncing the iPad with the
Mac a couple times. The first thing I got for my trouble was that iTunes
decided I had 7.1GB of video on the iPad, and now I&#8217;m over capacity by 6GB
(this without me having added any additional content to the iPad, actually).
The second thing I got for my trouble was that iTunes decided to sync that
video content back to the Mac, which took all night, and resulted in 70GB of
corrupt data: it created 3 .m4v files which were actually directories
containing what looks like the entire iPad filesystem, 2 of which were named
after the movie that caused/revealed all this trouble (Safety Not Guaranteed)
and the 3rd of which was an episode of Breaking Bad which I didn&#8217;t realize was
on the iPad in the first place. I&#8217;ll repeat: what got synced back to my
computer in each case was not a valid .m4v file, but an entire directory
structure whose top level ended in &#8220;.m4v&#8221;; one of these was 10GB, one was
20GB, and one was 40GB. Clearly, these weren&#8217;t actually on the iPad, and no,
my Mac didn&#8217;t really like the resulting 70GB of garbage data either.
(Something created what should have been .m4v files on the iPad as symbolic
links to /, maybe? <a href="http://metamatt.com/static/2012/10/crazy-ipad-movie-sync.txt">The entire directory listing is
here</a> if anyone
finds this edifying.)</p>

<p>Back to reality. Apparently the fix for this <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2562027?start=90&amp;tstart=0">runaway &#8220;Other&#8221;
usage</a> is to
back up the iPad, then restore it from backup. So I did this, and after half
an hour, I had a working iPad with 2.2GB of apps, 3.3GB of &#8220;other&#8221;, and 7.3GB
free. That&#8217;s still not very satisfying, though &#8211; what is this 3.3GB and how
do I get it back?</p>

<p>So then I tried completely erasing and restoring the iPad (restoring the
firmware, not just the user data, which is a similarly named but differently
implemented operation in iTunes). This worked a little too well — the iPad
came back with only 0.62GB of &#8220;other&#8221; and 13.2GB free, because it has no apps
installed. Um, that&#8217;s partially my fault, because I&#8217;d turned off syncing of
apps in iTunes (in my experience, leaving app syncing enabled makes syncing
take much longer and sometimes forever, and it shouldn&#8217;t be necessary in the
post-PC mode where you manage the device on the device itself); I don&#8217;t find
it obvious, but apparently if you disable the syncing of apps in iTunes, that
also means that local restores via iTunes don&#8217;t restore apps either.</p>

<p>But oh whatever, I have a recent iCloud backup which should have all the apps
backed up. I do another complete erase of the iPad, and this time when it
boots up, instead of driving the restore from iTunes on the Mac, I walk
through the on-device setup and select my iCloud backup. It chews for a while,
reboots, and then gets stuck forever at the boot screen (Apple logo with
progress bar). <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4372003?start=0&amp;tstart=0">Apparently I&#8217;m not the only one with this problem
either</a>. I
tried again and got the same result.</p>

<p>So apparently the iCloud backup is corrupt and can&#8217;t be used; the local backup
works but leaves me with extra work to do.</p>

<p>In the big picture, this is just another internet rant about a bug which
happened to one person and probably isn&#8217;t generally applicable, and while I
can describe it as 6 separate problems (iPad aborts my download without
showing an error message, iPad downloads movie to bit bucket and won&#8217;t play it
back, iPad runs out of space, iTunes can&#8217;t sanely describe space usage, iTunes
syncs garbage from iPad back to my computer, iCloud backup is corrupt) it&#8217;s
likely all one root cause, where some data structure got corrupted and caused
the rest of the failures downstream from there. And computers are complicated,
and not that expensive given the complexity, and hard and expensive to get
right.</p>

<p>But what&#8217;s frustrating about this is that Apple&#8217;s moved the openness needle
pretty far back toward walled garden, in the name of preventing problems.
Problems like malware, yes, but also problems due to misconfigurations, and
problems due to third party software that causes finger-pointing instead of
solutions. This was all first-party software; Apple content in Apple software
on an Apple device synced and controlled from another Apple device. No
jailbreaking, and I didn&#8217;t even commit the minor sin of trying to run iTunes
on Windows. This is the case that we should be getting right; that&#8217;s the
benefit that we&#8217;re paying the walled-garden cost for.</p>

<p>Apple is often applauded for bringing us technology that &#8220;just works&#8221;, but
I&#8217;ve been having more and more experiences lately that are pretty far from
&#8220;just works&#8221;. The moral of the story is that Apple&#8217;s devices are computers
just like other computers; they&#8217;re still a stack of fiendishly complex
hardware and software components; also with iOS in version 6 and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_version_history#Version_history">iTunes in
version
10.7</a>
there&#8217;s a lot of untestable legacy cruft. &#8220;Just works&#8221; sounds nice, but we&#8217;re
not really there yet, or maybe we&#8217;ve been there but don&#8217;t know how to stay
there for long.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read two extensive reviews of Microsoft&#8217;s new Surface tablets today.</p>

<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/microsofts-first-stab-at-a%0A-pc-surface-reviewed/">Peter Bright, writing for Ars
Technica</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>They&#8217;re covered in polyurethane that should prove hard-wearing and water
resistant (I was told that they should withstand scouring pads, though I admit
I&#8217;m too chicken to try—we had to promise to return our review units unharmed)</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/reviews/2012/10%0A/microsoft-surface/all/">Mathew Honan, writing for Wired</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>And it’s quite sturdy, to boot. In Microsoft’s lab, we saw Surfaces that had
been opened and closed hundreds of thousands of times. They still snapped open
and shut like they were new. We wanted to see how easy it was to break one.
It’s very possible, but you have to really try. We did manage to break off the
kickstand by gradually leaning onto it, but I had to put nearly my full weight
onto the tablet before the kickstand snapped off.</p></blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote><p>Microsoft showed us a drop test by letting a Surface fall from a chest-high
height. I duplicated this by literally throwing it at the floor, but to no ill
effect.</p></blockquote>

<p>All in the name of science, of course. I doubt Bright could have gotten in
that much trouble for taking a Brillo pad to his Touch Cover. Oh well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, it&#8217;s come to this:</p>

<p><a href="ht%0Atp://www.flickr.com/photos/67861147@N00/8052630604"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8031/8052630604_7c3946ed99.jpg" alt="IMG_1136" /></a></p>

<p>I waited a week after iOS 6 was released, asked my Facebook friends what they
thought of it, and within hours got 6 responses that all said not to upgrade
if I care about maps. Well, I do care about maps, but how bad can it be? I
wanted to see for myself, but not shoot myself in the foot on the phone I
depend on daily, so I upgraded my iPad instead.</p>

<p>Actually, the new 3D view is very cool where the data is good, and here in San
Francisco the data is good. Zooming around my neighborhood is fun and looks
great; that&#8217;s a real win. In fact the maps overall look great, and the zooming
is much smoother than what we&#8217;re used to with the Google-powered maps in
previous versions of iOS. How about the underlying data? Um, not so good.
Roads are (in my experience) where they belong, but addresses and landmarks
and businesses are often not. I don&#8217;t know why anyone is surprised by this;
it&#8217;s a very hard problem, and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/how-google-builds-%0Aits-maps-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-everything/261913/">Google has worked incredibly
hard</a> (and thrown a
lot of money, human time, and computer time at acquiring and massaging the
data) to get their maps to the point we all take for granted now. The world is
very big.</p>

<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s pleasant when I search for an address a mile from where
I&#8217;m standing and get a search result for a similarly named street 1000 miles
away in Texas. That&#8217;s what happened to me the first time I tried actually
using Maps for real, i.e. to find something whose location I didn&#8217;t already
know. I also tried plugging in a few locations I remember from our trip to
Ireland, where iOS 5 maps (i.e. Google maps) got us everywhere we needed to
be, and Apple maps didn&#8217;t know them; that trip would have been much harder.</p>

<p>But luckily, the built-in Maps app powered by Apple&#8217;s fledgling data set isn&#8217;t
your only choice, and that&#8217;s what my screen shot above reflects. I tried the
various alternatives shown here before upgrading, and came to roughly the same
conclusions as <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/10/replacing-ios-6-maps-hands-on-%0Awith-mapquest-bing-waze-google-nokia/">this Ars Technica
article</a>: Waze is neat for navigation but not a
replacement map; MapQuest is pretty unpleasant to use; the Google Maps website
actually works just fine; upon confirming that last, I decided it was fine to
upgrade.</p>

<p>More surprising to me is that it&#8217;s Nokia who has the second-best map
experience — both data quality and interaction design — after Google. (Maybe I
shouldn&#8217;t have been surprised. I remember reading about <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/02/calling-all-cars-%0Ameasuring-traffic-using-cell-phone-data/">Nokia&#8217;s Mobile
Millenium project</a> and thinking that while their
approach seemed more like academia than industry and Google is probably
leaving them in the dust in terms of speed of deploying new features, their
very thoughtful approach especially with respect to privacy is commendable.
Clearly, they&#8217;ve been taking this seriously.) I tried, again, punching in some
of the hotels we stayed in in Ireland, which Google could locate and Apple
couldn&#8217;t, and Nokia found them just fine. That test involves just a few data
points, but is in keeping with a general reputation that only Google and Nokia
have decent place data outside the US.</p>

<p>So the obvious conclusion: Apple should just buy Nokia.</p>
