  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google recently announced that after January 2013, they&rsquo;ll be <a href="http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2716936">deprecating EAS
access to
Gmail</a> (and
calendar, and address book) for free customers (addresses ending in
@gmail.com, and free Google Apps accounts). It&rsquo;ll still be available for paid
Google Apps customers, and it&rsquo;ll keep working for normal customers who are
already using it, but only on their existing devices.</p>

<p>This is bad news because EAS (aka Google Sync) has been and continues to be
the best way to get Google services on an iOS device. In my opinion, iOS +
Google Sync continues to be the best combination of mobile device and cloud
services, but this change makes them work a little less well together.</p>

<p>Google Sync (EAS) is the best way to connect iOS to Google services because</p>

<ul>
<li>One &ldquo;account&rdquo; (setup step in iOS) handles mail, contacts and calendars.</li>
<li>Until September 2012, this was the only way to sync contacts between iOS and Google.</li>
<li>Mail works better: Push works, and the delete button works the way you&rsquo;d expect. (Supposedly both iOS mail client and Gimap mail server support IMAP IDLE, but they disagree on how, or something, because the result doesn&rsquo;t work.)</li>
<li>Also, if you enable Google&rsquo;s 2-factor authentication, you need to generate fallback &ldquo;app-specific&rdquo; passwords for all your devices<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and for EAS this is one per device, and without EAS it&rsquo;s at least two<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>


<p>For these reasons, especially the second one, I&rsquo;ve been using — and
recommending to friends and family — EAS as the preferred way of connecting to
Google accounts. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t even realize that contact sync was now
possible without it (Google just added CardDAV support in September 2012).</p>

<p>Similarly, I&rsquo;ve been using — and recommending to friends and family — Google
Apps (Gmail and friends) as my preferred provider for cloud
mail/contacts/calendars. Apple&rsquo;s track record for cloud mail services is
spotty; even if iCloud is improving, I just don&rsquo;t see the advantage over
Google, especially if you don&rsquo;t want to tie yourself to Apple devices
forever<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>That leaves us trying to connect iOS to Google&rsquo;s services as best we can.
Which to be fair is pretty good, but losing EAS is a step back<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. This speaks
to <a href="http://levelsofdetail.kendeeter.com/post/31926718063/maps">something my friend Ken wrote months
ago</a> (in the
context of the maps kerfuffle):</p>

<blockquote><p>Why is it that two tech giants with best-of-breed tech in different areas
rarely seem to be able to cooperate to produce an awesome product for the
user?</p></blockquote>

<p>This has been a bright spot in this regard, which is getting a little less
bright at the end of January.</p>

<p>Google probably doesn&rsquo;t care about keeping free EAS working because, in order
of preference, they&rsquo;d like to see</p>

<ul>
<li>You using an Android device to connect to Gmail+friends</li>
<li>You using a (paid) Google Apps for Business account</li>
<li>And for anyone else, using a non-Google device to connect to a free Google account, there are still the open protocols (IMAP for mail, CardDAV and CalDAV for calendar and contacts).</li>
</ul>


<p>Apple may not care about optimizing the Gmail experience for iOS users because</p>

<ul>
<li>They&rsquo;d like to see you using iCloud for mail+contacts+calendars</li>
<li>Plus they&rsquo;ve already connected you to Google services using EAS, so why should they have to do it again differently.</li>
</ul>


<p>In fairness to Apple, adding a &ldquo;Gmail&rdquo; account to iOS adds both mail and
calendars (IMAP + CalDAV), and Google only added CardDAV support on the server
side in September 2012 (i.e. after the current iOS release). Maybe, hopefully,
Apple will make iOS &ldquo;Gmail&rdquo; accounts start supporting calendars via CardDAV in
the next release. In the meantime, you have to do it manually.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see any reason why the open-protocol support from iOS to Google
services couldn&rsquo;t work just as well as EAS — if one setup step added all 3
protocols, and if push were made to work — but it&rsquo;s not the case now.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s too bad that native device clients basically negate the advantage of 2-factor authentication, since they aren&rsquo;t compatible and force you to use the fallback mechanism.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p>One for the &ldquo;Gmail&rdquo; account supporting IMAP and CalDAV, and one for the separate CardDAV account you have to add.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been wanting a way to preview
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>-formatted text files
from the terminal, ideally via <a href="http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/">less</a>.
Primarily, I think, because Github encourages it, a lot of open source
projects are starting to include a
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=+readme.md">README.md</a> instead of a plain old
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README">README</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>; these marked-down READMEs are
easy to view in Github&rsquo;s web interface but not after (or before) you clone the
repo into your own filesystem.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s <code>zless</code> that can understand compressed files; why not <code>mdless</code> that
can understand Markdown files?</p>

<p>I went looking and stackoverflow came to the rescue with this question and
answer about a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/7603703/275581">less-style markdown viewer for UNIX
systems</a>, suggesting
<a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a> as the tool to translate from
Markdown format to troff format. The suggested incantation there works for me
under Debian Linux but not under Mac OS X because it relies on <code>man</code>&rsquo;s <code>-l</code>
option, which I&rsquo;m guessing is a GNU addition not supported by BSD <code>man</code>. I had
to figure out how to duplicate the processing that <code>man -l</code> does, which I knew
involved <code>troff</code> (or <code>groff</code>); it turns out that <code>groff</code> understands a <code>-man</code>
flag which predefines the macros used by manpages. The version using <code>groff</code>
instead of <code>man -l</code> seems more portable (it works fine under Linux as well as
Mac OS X), so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll use.</p>

<p>Hence, the following incantation to view a README.md file:</p>

<p><code>pandoc -s -f markdown -t man README.md | groff -T utf8 -man | less</code></p>

<p>Or, a <code>mdless</code> command implemented as a tcsh alias:</p>

<p><code>alias mdless "pandoc -s -f markdown -t man \!* | groff -T utf8 -man | less"</code></p>
<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn:1">
<p>As one data point for when this became common, README.md was added to the short list of common readme file names in this Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=README&amp;oldid=480712255">March 7, 2012</a>.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Twice in the last few months<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I&rsquo;ve had to do troubleshooting steps on
Vanessa&rsquo;s iMac that involved booting from alternate volumes<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This is normally
easy on a Mac, but not quite so easy on a Mac with a wireless Bluetooth
keyboard<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Both times, it was an exercise in frustration, as I give the reboot command
and wait about 10 seconds for the reboot to actually happen; then I hold
Command-R, watch the screen blink black, wait, watch it blink white, wait,
chime, wait, Apple logo, wait, and… oh hello, login screen! That&rsquo;s not right.
I&rsquo;ve just wasted a minute and I&rsquo;m back where I started.</p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718">support document on recovery
mode</a> makes it sound so easy:</p>

<blockquote><p>Restart your Mac and hold down the Command key and the R key (Command-R),
and keep holding them until the Apple icon appears, indicating that your Mac
is starting up. After the Recovery System is finished starting up, you should
see a desktop with a OS X menu bar and a &ldquo;Mac OS X Utilities&rdquo; application
window. Note: If you see a login window or your own desktop and icons, it is
possible that you didn&rsquo;t hold Command-R early enough. Restart and try again.</p></blockquote>

<p>After reading and rereading that, I try a few more times, holding Command-R
earlier and earlier as Apple recommends, and, no luck. Wait a minute, I&rsquo;m
using a Bluetooth keyboard. Does that cause complications, like, the computer
and keyboard aren&rsquo;t able to communicate right at the beginning of the boot
process? Yes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. Do I need to go find a USB keyboard to plug in? Not quite.</p>

<p>It turns out the magic answer is to reboot the computer, wait for the LED on
the keyboard to flash (which is after the computer starts booting and chimes
and does a self-test which on this iMac with 12GB of memory all takes about 20
seconds), and <em>then</em> immediately press and hold Command-R. Any earlier than
that, and you&rsquo;ll be ignored.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d think Apple&rsquo;s help docs could mention this, since they&rsquo;ve been shipping
Bluetooth keyboards by default with all their desktop machines for years now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Vanessa and I wanted to take a real destination trip with Dominic, kinda sorta
just to see if we could do it. Not that we were hoping or envisioning that it
would be impossible, but it was hard to visualize, so we had to try.</p>

<p>We settled on Ireland as the destination based on two propositions: we can
take the baby to the pub, and the people love babies. (These were the actual
reasons recommended by an Irish friend of Vanessa.) OK, not that we&rsquo;re such
raging alcoholics that we can only travel to pubs, but &ldquo;can take the baby to
the pub&rdquo; is actually a pretty good proxy for &ldquo;is not uptight, and will be
forgiving of people traveling with a baby&rdquo;, which turned out to be true. Also
true is that the Irish were not only gracious and charming hosts, but that
many of them indeed like babies and know how to show it. For us, this
translated to both people being prepared and understanding, but also to a lot
of free entertainment. Dominic likes a lot of stimulation, and he got it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty proud of our itinerary, in retrospect, because we were making it up
as we went along and it turned out really easy. No doubt it helps that Ireland
is a small country, native English speaking (almost), and the people and
culture are easygoing, so probably anything you do there is likely to go well.
Still, for us it turned out remarkably easy to travel.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where we went:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67861147@N00/8219093821"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8482/8219093821_5003d3ab9%0A0.jpg" alt="Ireland travel map" /></a></p>

<p>The itinerary, of which I&rsquo;m proud because the transfers were so easy and
involved only public transit: We flew from San Francisco to London and then
immediately to Dublin and caught the city bus to our hotel. Dublin: 3 days
walking around, with a side DART trip to Howth. Then we walked from our hotel
to Heuston Station and caught the Irish Rail train to Galway, where we stayed
at a hotel a block away from the train station. Galway: 2 days walking around,
with a bus/boat trip to Inishmore (largest of the Arran Islands). Then we
rented a car from the Budget office right next to the train station and drove
south to the Cliffs of Moher, with an overnight stay at Ennis, then to Dingle.
Dingle: 2 days walking around, with a drive around the peninsula loop. Then we
drove onwards to the Kerry Peninsula and around the Ring of Kerry, then to
Kenmare. Kenmare: 2 days walking around including a hilly and marshy segment
of the Kerry Way. Finally, leaving Kenmare, we drove past Cork to Waterford,
dropped our rental car off at the tiny airport there, and caught a flight back
to London Luton, from where it was an easy train ride to the London
neighborhood we were staying in.</p>

<p>Some photographic evidence of highlights from Ireland:</p>

<p>PGE&rsquo;s NEM billing scheme <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2012/11/09/one-year-of-solar-power/">blends usage across
seasons</a> to
allow for seasonal variation in generated power, and their E-6 billing scheme
<a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2012/11/11/e-1-vs-e-6-for-residential-%0Asolar-customers/">separates usage into 5 time-of-use
periods</a> to encourage customers to shift usage away from peak
periods.</p>

<p>A question that just occurred to me is whether you can game their billing
results by time-shifting usage around inside the same true-up period, between
TOU zones, months, or even seasons.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty easy to move usage between TOU zones of the same day (say between
summer on-peak and summer off-peak) by delaying energy-hungry activities like
baking pies until night; that&rsquo;s both tractable for a home customer and exactly
the kind of behavior the E-6 TOU billing rates are designed to encourage.
Moving usage between TOU zones of different seasons (say between summer on-
peak and winter off-peak), or even from one monthly billing cycle to another,
would be more difficult (it&rsquo;s possible in theory but doesn&rsquo;t really match
human activity patterns to delay all your energy-hungry activities for months
and then execute them in a big batch months later; alternatively you&rsquo;d need a
really big battery which is exactly what grid tie-in lets you avoid), but I&rsquo;m
still curious if it would be advantageous in some circumstances.</p>

<p>Again drawing on the example of my last year&rsquo;s experience, the answer turns
out to be yes for both forms of time-shifting. Say you&rsquo;re going to bake a
bunch of pies, and need to run the oven at 3KW for a little over 3 hours,
consuming 10 KWh of electricity. (The 3 KW figure is realistic for an electric
oven; the heating element running continuously is not; ignore that in the
service of an example.) If you&rsquo;re going to consume that 10 KWh, does it matter
<em>when</em> you consume it; what&rsquo;s the effect on your final true-up bill of adding
10 KWh at various different times?</p>

<p>If you can move that 10 KWh from a higher-value TOU period to a lower-value
TOU period in the same day, you win; this turns out to be independent of
tiering, consumption, or which month or season you&rsquo;re in, which is a nice
property. It won&rsquo;t change your overall consumption for that day or month, so
it won&rsquo;t change your tiering calculation. If you had a surplus in the higher-
value TOU period, you&rsquo;ll now have a bigger surplus, which at the higher rate
is more than enough to buy the same electricity back from PG&amp;E later in the
day, even if the solar cells aren&rsquo;t producing at that time. (Basically, it
wasn&rsquo;t immediately obvious to me what the credit/charge calculations do in
this case, because my intuition keeps wanting to tell me it&rsquo;s better to
consume energy when I&rsquo;m getting it free from my solar panels than when I&rsquo;m
buying it from PG&amp;E. That turns out not to be true; the NEM system means if
you buy and sell the same amount of electricity at a given rate, it&rsquo;s a wash,
and the TOU system actually rewards you for selling it at a higher rate and
buying it back at a lower rate.) So yes, you can &ldquo;game&rdquo; the E-6 billing system
by moving usage from peak times to off-peak times, which use of &ldquo;game&rdquo; gets
scare quotes because it&rsquo;s actually the behavior they want to encourage.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, if you could move that same 10 KWh across months, the story is a
lot more complicated. Due to tiering, you may be paying more than the baseline
rate for some of your electricity, and since PG&amp;E applies the tiering
calculations entirely inside each month, based on that month&rsquo;s usage, you can
actually get crossover between &ldquo;high-value&rdquo; and &ldquo;low-value&rdquo; TOU periods. More
concretely: as a solar generator, you may be paying more for winter off-peak
electricity at 3rd-tier rates than you are for summer part-peak electricity
where you never exceed the first tier. This is exactly what happened to me
over the last year (note in the <a href="http://www.pge.com/tariffs/tm2/pdf/ELEC_SCHEDS_E-6.pdf">E-6
schedule</a> that winter
off-peak and part-peak above 130% of baseline cost about what summer on-peak
baseline usage does, and winter off-peak and part-peak above 200% of baseline
cost more than the summer on-peak baseline). While from the previous example
you&rsquo;d expect the result of time-shifting your usage to depend on the TOU rates
(and you would win by shifting from a high-rate TOU to a low-rate TOU, and
lose by doing the reverse), in fact it also depends on the tiering
calculations, and you can also win by shifting usage out of a month where you
had higher-tier usage into a month where you didn&rsquo;t, and this can even be true
if it involves shifting that usage from a low-rate TOU to a higher-rate TOU.
So, surprisingly, you could see a net benefit from moving usage from winter to
summer; it&rsquo;s pretty easy to make the numbers work out if moving from winter
part-peak to summer part-peak, and in extreme cases, you could even win by
moving from winter off-peak to summer on-peak. This is decidedly not the
result they want to encourage, so I&rsquo;d call it gaming the system. (Of course,
you&rsquo;d need a way to actually buffer your usage across months; a better way to
lower your winter bills is to simply use less electricity, without
compensating in the opposite direction in the summer.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll note again that this perverse result derives from the fact that PG&amp;E
calculates and finalizes the tiering calculations entirely inside each month,
instead of smoothing them across the true-up period, so it&rsquo;s actually possible
for a big energy user with an even bigger solar array to generate a net
surplus for the year but be paying 4th-tier rates for winter electricity when
the array is underperforming.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a follow-on to my <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2012/11/09/one-year-of-solar-power/">article on understanding the PG&amp;E NEM
bill</a>, I
decided to go back and recalculate our usage charges for the normal E-1
billing schedule, in addition to the E-6 I&rsquo;m actually using.</p>

<p>I also threw in the calculation for the E-1 value of the electricity we
generated instead of buying from PG&amp;E, that is, how much we would have spent
to buy all the electricity we used from PG&amp;E if we hadn&rsquo;t installed the solar
array.</p>

<p>In short, E-6 was a solid win for us: a usage charge of $64.54 would have been
$275.10 with E-1<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The results:</p>

<p>E-6 was a solid win for us. In the 6 winter months where we had a usage
charge, the usage charge was about $10/month higher with E-1<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. In the 6 summer
months where we had a usage credit, the usage credit was about $30/month lower
with E-1<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>On the flip side, E-6 has a &ldquo;meter charge&rdquo; of approximately 25 cents per day,
or $92 per year<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, which E-1 does not. So our true E-6 cost (for electrical
usage, plus the privilege of E-6 TOU billing) is $156.88 for the year, and
E-1&rsquo;s true cost remains at $275.10.</p>

<p>It seems like E-6 would be an easy win for anyone who can generate all of
their summer on-peak electricity, or especially all of their summer on-peak
and summer partial-peak electricity. (You can compare the exact prices in the
E-1 and E-6 billing schedules, but the E-6 off-peak rates and winter part-peak
rates are lower than E-1 rates; E-6 summer part-peak rates are a little higher
than E-1 rates; E-6 summer on-peak rates are a lot higher than E-1 rates.)</p>

<p>I also remember being told that PG&amp;E will let you switch from E-1 to E-6 and
then at the end of the first year, if you didn&rsquo;t save money, you can take a
mulligan and retroactively undo the switch and pay the E-1 rate. I can&rsquo;t find
confirmation of that on PG&amp;E&rsquo;s website today, though.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr/>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>You may notice that my earlier article lists our usage charge for the year as $60.22 and here it&rsquo;s $64.54; the difference is that $60.22 is PG&amp;E&rsquo;s number and $64.54 is my calculation for what it should be (and I had to fudge the numbers for October 2011 where PG&amp;E switched me from the old plan to NEM midway through the billing cycle, plus we may round differently, plus there may be other errors in my calculations). This seemed close enough to go through the rest of the exercise, and the technique used to calculate this number is the same one I&rsquo;ll use for the E-1 number, so this seemed like the one to use for this comparison.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>E-6 is always a win in the winter, because there&rsquo;s no winter peak zone; winter part-peak and winter off-peak are both cheaper than the E-1 rate. And between the solar array and our usage patterns, the vast majority of our PG&amp;E usage was in the off-peak time anyway.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>Between the solar array and our usage patterns, we ran a surplus in summer on-peak and summer part-peak for nearly the entire summer, and had to buy summer electricity only off-peak. This is exactly the behavior that E-6 is designed to encourage, and it rewarded us correspondingly.<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>So if you want a true zero bill from E-6, you need to generate enough of a surplus that it would counterbalance this $92/year &ldquo;meter charge&rdquo;. That would take 495 KWh of summer on-peak surplus or 1028 KWh of summer part-peak surplus, paid out at the &ldquo;generation&rdquo; rate due to the NSC rules.<a href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I got solar panels installed on the roof of our house last fall, friends
immediately started asking how well they were working out, and my answer had
to be that while they&rsquo;re <a href="https://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/public/systems/g8ah32261">generating a nice amount of
power</a>, I
wouldn&rsquo;t know how well they were doing on the actual goal of zeroing our
electric bill until a year had passed. That year has now passed, and it&rsquo;s time
to answer the question.</p>

<p>If you add solar power to your grid energy, at least the way it&rsquo;s done in
California, two things will happen:</p>

<ol>
<li> Your electric bills will be lower, but</li>
<li> You won&rsquo;t understand them.</li>
</ol>


<h2>The problem:</h2>

<p>California electric rates are confusing because they&rsquo;re complicated and
variable. You pay a different rate depending on how much you use (tiering)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.
You can opt into time-of-use (TOU) billing<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, which makes electricity more
expensive at peak times and cheaper the rest of the time to encourage you to
shift usage away from peak times. The normal residential billing schedule is
called <a href="http://www.pge.com/tariffs/tm2/pdf/ELEC_SCHEDS_E-1.pdf">E-1 (&ldquo;residential
services&rdquo;)</a> and shows
5 different rates according to tier; the TOU residential schedule is called
<a href="http://www.pge.com/tariffs/tm2/pdf/ELEC_SCHEDS_E-6.pdf">E-6 (&ldquo;residential time-of-use
service&rdquo;)</a> and shows
25 different rates according to tier and time.</p>

<p>Once you introduce solar (or other generation capabilities) into the mix,
there&rsquo;s another wrinkle. Assuming you stay connected to the grid, PG&amp;E will
convert your billing to what they call <a href="http://www.pge.com/standardnem/">NEM</a>
(Net Energy Metering), which means your electric meter will measure the flow
of power in both directions — from the grid into your house when you&rsquo;re using
more than you&rsquo;re generating, and from your house back to the grid when you&rsquo;re
generating more than you&rsquo;re using. But solar panel output varies by season and
with weather, in addition to the obvious day/night cycle. To account for this
seasonal variation, PG&amp;E bills NEM customers on a yearly cycle called the
<a href="http://www.pge.com/myhome/myaccount/explanationofbill/nem/">true-up period</a>.
Your monthly bills are only an approximation, and at the end of the year they
calculate the actual balance owed compared to what you already paid, and have
you &ldquo;true up&rdquo; to that amount, hence the name.</p>

<p>For NEM customers, that&rsquo;s 3 different axes of variation<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>: tiered rates based
on total consumption, variable rates due to time-of-use, and true-up billing
to account for seasonal variation of generated output.</p>

<h2>Before adding solar generation</h2>

<p>You have to calculate how much electricity you want to generate to produce the
desired effect (economically or ecologically or both<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>), and then you need to
calculate the size of a PV solar array that will produce that effect.</p>

<p>Both of these calculations actually turn out to involve a fair amount of
prediction. Companies that specialize in solar installations (for example,
<a href="http://www.luminalt.com/meet-luminalt/about-us">Luminalt</a>, who installed
ours) can help you with these predictions and calculations.</p>

<p>But even after you&rsquo;ve done the calculations, decided to go solar, and had the
array installed and it&rsquo;s live, you still won&rsquo;t know if you were right, at
least for a while. That&rsquo;s what this post is about. I wanted to know if we&rsquo;d
predicted correctly, and I also wanted to know if PG&amp;E&rsquo;s billing methods
fairly account for the seasonal variation. (If I have a large surplus in
summer on-peak in July, and a big deficit in winter off-peak in January, do
these cancel out, and how?)</p>

<h2>After adding solar generation</h2>

<p>I said that after activating a solar array and switching over to PG&amp;E&rsquo;s NEM
program, you&rsquo;ll get lower bills that you won&rsquo;t understand. Here&rsquo;s what I mean.
Each month with my electric bill<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>, I get a separate &ldquo;Net energy metering
electric statement&rdquo;. It includes three amounts:</p>

<ol>
<li> &ldquo;total current month&rsquo;s billed amount&rdquo;, which is always in the neighborhood of $12.</li>
<li> &ldquo;current month energy charge or credit&rdquo;, which is the actual charge for electricity I used, or credit for electricity I produced, after accounting for tiered TOU rates.</li>
<li> &ldquo;cumulative energy charges or credits for the current true-up period&rdquo;, which is the sum of the #2 values.</li>
</ol>


<p>This is hard to interpret month by month, partly because there&rsquo;s no
relationship between what I&rsquo;m asked to pay (#1) and what I used (#2), and #3
will swing wildly one direction<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> and then correct over the course of the year.
All of this evens out at the end of the year, which is the reason for the
1-year true-up method of billing.</p>

<p>But when the 1-year anniversary arrives, and with it the final true-up
payment, there&rsquo;s a new confusing quantity: &ldquo;total current month&rsquo;s billed
amount&rdquo; is replaced with &ldquo;total true-up billed amount&rdquo;. This amount, which is
your actual bill for the 12th month, is not the usual $12, bears no obvious
relationship to the cumulative energy charge, and isn&rsquo;t explained or derived
by PG&amp;E on the bill or elsewhere that I could find<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. (In my case: my
cumulative energy charge after 12 months was $60.22, and the &ldquo;total true-up
billed amount&rdquo; was $22.02.) Why?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a method to their madness, but I had to dig deep into PG&amp;E&rsquo;s rate
documentation and then spend a few hours messing with a spreadsheet to try to
derive the calculations that would map my usage to my bills.</p>

<h2>Understanding true-up billing</h2>

<p>First, the monthly bill. Where does this $12 come from? It turns out PG&amp;E
charges E-6 (TOU) customers a &ldquo;meter charge&rdquo; of approximately $0.25 per day.
E6 and E-1 both also have a &ldquo;minimum charge&rdquo; of approximately $0.15 per day;
they don&rsquo;t explain what this means, but if my reverse engineering of my bills
is correct, for NEM customers it&rsquo;s essentially a placeholder for your usage
before they know what your usage is. These fees added together and multiplied
by the number of days in a billing cycle yield the approximately $12 amount
that I was billed for each month (billing cycles ranged from 28 to 32 days, so
the monthly bill ranged from $11.22 to $12.83, with the most common bill being
$12.02 for a 30-day billing cycle).</p>

<p>Second, the usage charges. These are not simple (since they involve both the
tiering and TOU calculations), but they are actually decently explained on the
monthly NEM statement itself, and with one nitpicky exception<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>, they&rsquo;re the
same as what you had before you added NEM, and the true-up calculation doesn&rsquo;t
affect them.</p>

<p>Third, the cumulative usage charge. This one is completely straightforward:
add the usage charges for the current true-up period, to date. Each NEM
statement shows the current cumulative charge (this amount) and the amount by
which it changed (the month&rsquo;s usage charge), and you can verify that the
current cumulative balance is equal to the previous month&rsquo;s balance plus/minus
the current month&rsquo;s usage charge/credit. However, as mentioned above, this
amount will swing one direction and then correct due to seasonal variation,</p>

<p>Fourth, the true-up amount. This is a simple calculation if you know where it
comes from, but PG&amp;E doesn&rsquo;t explain it, so I had to reverse engineer it,
learning to understand the daily meter and minimum charges. What it boils down
to is that the $0.15 &ldquo;minimum charge&rdquo; is not a real charge once the true-up
period is over, but a provisional placeholder: you pay this with each month&rsquo;s
$12 bill, but at the end of the year, when your real usage is known, you get
back the provisional amount and pay the real amount. At the end of the year,
you take your usage charge/credit, and add the meter charge ($0.25 per day or
about $7.50 per monthly bill or $92.33 in a full year<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>), and that&rsquo;s what you
owe for the year. Except you&rsquo;ve already paid that meter charge, plus you&rsquo;ve
paid the &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; usage charge as a provisional placeholder. So subtract the
provisional usage charge ($0.15 per day or about $4.50 per monthly bill or
$53.96 in a full year), and you have the amount that&rsquo;s unpaid, that you must
still pay in order to True Up. So, your first 11 bills are for 30-ish days of
meter charges and minimum charges, totaling about $12; your 12th bill is for
30-ish days of meter charges, minus 335-ish days of minimum charges, plus your
cumulative usage charge for the whole year. In my case, actual usage at the
end of the year was $60.22, of which $46.27 had already been paid monthly as
that &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; charge, so what I&rsquo;d call the actual true-up component was
$13.95; add in $8.07 in meter fees (32 days at $0.25/day) for the final
billing period and we have what PG&amp;E calls my true-up bill of $22.02.</p>

<h2>Cancelation across TOU periods</h2>

<p>I was curious whether a surplus in one TOU period (for example, summer on-
peak, which is likely the best case for residential solar customers) can
partially or wholly cancel a deficit in another TOU period (for example,
winter off-peak, which is pretty much entirely dark, and thus worst-case for
solar customers). As it turns out, PG&amp;E doesn&rsquo;t directly add and subtract
usage across TOU periods; they convert usage to a dollar amount every month
(based on TOU periods and tiering), then add and subtract the monthly dollar
amounts. This is a clever way of accounting, since it&rsquo;s pretty easy to
understand, and does a pretty fair job of reconciling the amounts from
different TOU periods. (In fact, it works out pretty well for residential
solar customers, since your summer on-peak surplus is credited at a higher
rate than that winter off-peak deficit.) My only complaint here is again that
the tiering calculations are done per month and only affect you on the
downside.</p>

<h2>Raw facts</h2>

<p>Here are the actual numbers from my house over the last year, which may be
helpful in understanding the derivations here, making the descriptions more
concrete, and/or planning your own PV solar system.</p>

<ul>
<li>Generated by solar: 7195 KWh</li>
<li>Bought from PG&amp;E: 1601 KWh</li>
<li>Total consumed: 8796 KWh</li>
<li>Months with positive grid usage, resulting in PGE charge: 6 (Oct-Mar)</li>
<li>Months with negative grid usage, resulting in PG&amp;E credit: 6 (Apr-Sept)</li>
<li>Whole-year usage charge: $60.22</li>
<li>Value of electricity consumed if I had to buy it all from PG&amp;E: $2052.34 (assuming E-1 and not E-6 billing, since I don&rsquo;t have the generated KWh broken out by TOU period)</li>
<li>Prior-year electric bill: $1403.77</li>
<li>Granular usage (from PG&amp;E&rsquo;s point of view), broken down by month and TOU billing period:</li>
</ul>


<h2>Sum-up</h2>

<p>The true-up billing method mostly but not entirely allows you to smooth out
the seasonal variation, canceling bad performance one month against good
performance in another month.</p>

<p>You can understand your monthly bills if you think of them like this: $12 a
month, $7.50 of which is just for the privilege of being connected to the
grid, and $4.50 of which is a deposit against your actual usage. Meanwhile,
the actual usage bill accrues in the background, and at the end of the year,
you pay this balance minus a $49.50 refund for those eleven $4.50 deposits.</p>

<p>Due to the low NCS reimbursement it still seems to me that the optimal array
size is what brings you very close to even for the year, offsetting your usage
without generating much of a surplus. However, due to the way usage tiers are
finalized each month instead of across the true-up period, sizing your array
slightly larger than this may pay off by reducing higher-tier winter bills,
even though the net surplus KWh aren&rsquo;t themselves valuable in the NCS
calculation.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<p>The baseline usage, which determines the details of the tiering calculation, further varies by where you live in California and whether your home has a gas or electric primary heat source.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>You can opt into TOU billing regardless of whether you have solar or other generation facilities, but in general, it makes a lot of sense if you have generation capabilities and less sense if you don&rsquo;t, plus most people not planning on adding solar won&rsquo;t have the TOU option waved in their face and probably don&rsquo;t even know about it. I don&rsquo;t know the exact numbers, but I presume most NEM customers opt for TOU billing, and most grid-only customers do not.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>There&rsquo;s another confusing way they split things up, but I&rsquo;m not denoting it as an axis because it&rsquo;s not orthogonal to the others. PG&amp;E separates the rate into separate quantities for &ldquo;generation&rdquo;, &ldquo;transmission&rdquo;, &ldquo;distribution&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the funding of public purpose programs&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ll come back to the reason for this bookkeeping sleight-of-hand later; it doesn&rsquo;t really matter unless you generate a surplus, but if you do, look for this to raise its head in the Net Surplus Compensation calculation.<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>If you believe solar power is cleaner than grid power, the ecologically optimal size for your home array is &ldquo;as large as possible&rdquo;, though of course there&rsquo;s some ecological cost to PV panel manufacturing too. But if you&rsquo;re trying to make your solar array economically viable, you&rsquo;ll want to compare actual costs and benefits; the costs depend on the cost and output of the array and how long you plan to keep it and whether you buy or lease and the details of the financing, all things you can find <a href="http://www.gosolarnow.com/NetMetering.html">companies or calculators</a> to help with. The benefits depend on what you&rsquo;re actually paying for grid electricity, which follows the complicated calculations already described. If you&rsquo;re a light user paying baseline $0.12/KWh rates, you&rsquo;ll save less than a heavy user paying 4th-tier $0.34/KWh rates. While the specifics vary, it&rsquo;s probably easy to generate solar power for less than $0.34/KWh and somewhat hard to generate solar power for less than $0.12/KWh. What this means is most solar customers try to offset most but not all of their own usage, to get back down in the baseline tier. It&rsquo;s often not cost-effective to compete with PG&amp;E&rsquo;s baseline rates. It&rsquo;s especially cost-ineffective to operate at a net surplus, because of the way PG&amp;E values the surplus: read their <a href="http://www.pge.com/myhome/saveenergymoney/solarenergy/afterinstalling/ab920/">Net Surplus Compensation</a> rules, paying special attention to the last section, &ldquo;Why is NSC less than the credit on my NEM statement?&rdquo;. In short, PG&amp;E splits the &ldquo;retail&rdquo; rates that you&rsquo;re used to seeing into separate components for generation, transmission, distribution, and the funding of public programs like nuclear plant decommissioning; your NEM credits come back at the retail rate until you hit break-even; however if you operate at a surplus, PG&amp;E pays only a &ldquo;wholesale-type rate for generation&rdquo;. You can see the actual breakdown on the E-1 or E-6 billing schedules; I don&rsquo;t actually know how to calculate the breakdown for E-6 since your surplus is for the year and it&rsquo;s not clear which TOU rate to apply; in any case generation is less than half of the total.<a href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:5">
<p>Actually not <em>with</em> my electric bill, because I&rsquo;ve opted for paperless billing and told PG&amp;E to stop sending me paperless bills, and I can look at the details on the website. But none of the NEM details are available on their website, nor is there an option to go paperless for the NEM data. So what actually happens is the NEM data shows up on paper in my mailbox a few days after I get the bill itself electronically.<a href="#fnref:5" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:6">
<p>Which direction it swings will depend on when your true-up period starts. Mine starts in October and so the first few months are fall and winter, and I accumulated quite a large charge before April when I started getting credits. By the following October, it was nearly back to 0. If your true-up period starts in April, you&rsquo;d presumably see the reverse, amassing a series of credits and a large negative balance over the summer before winter charges start to eat away at the credit balance.<a href="#fnref:6" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:7">
<p>PG&amp;E&rsquo;s explanation of how to read this is split into four pages on their website, for the <a href="http://www.pge.com/myhome/myaccount/explanationofbill/nem/">monthly statement</a>, <a href="http://www.pge.com/myhome/myaccount/explanationofbill/nem/monthlybill/">monthly bill</a>, <a href="http://www.pge.com/myhome/myaccount/explanationofbill/nem/trueupstatement/">true-up-statement</a>, and <a href="http://www.pge.com/myhome/myaccount/explanationofbill/nem/trueupstatement/">true-up bill</a>. These pages explain the meaning of each item on the bill, but don&rsquo;t explain how the amounts are calculated, or why you owe what you owe.<a href="#fnref:7" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:8">
<p>The true-up calculation doesn&rsquo;t affect the monthly usage charge calculation, but arguably it should, because the rates depend on tiering, the tiering depends on usage, and usage is supposed to be smoothed over the entire true-up period. But actually, the tiering calculations are done entirely inside each month. What this means is that in the winter when your solar array is underperforming, higher usage might push you into the upper tiers, and you&rsquo;ll pay more for your grid electricity because of this, and no amount of summer credits can offset these higher rates. Again using my first-year numbers as an example, my assigned baseline value for the year sums to 2878 units, and my actual cumulative usage was 1601 KWh. (Or: the average of the monthly baselines was 240, and my average monthly usage was 133.) I&rsquo;d argue that this means I should be paying only first-tier rates. However, because of the seasonal variation expected with solar generation, my usage from PG&amp;E&rsquo;s point of view is skewed heavily toward winter, and in fact I had above-baseline usage in only the 4 shortest months: November through February. Because PG&amp;E applies the baseline-to-tier calculation on each month&rsquo;s usage individually, instead of across the true-up period, I paid substantially more for electricity in those 4 months. In my case, I was charged $60.22 for my electricity usage, but if it had all been at baseline rates, I would have been owed a $5 credit.<a href="#fnref:8" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:9">
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this after my first year of NEM, and the PGE switched me over to NEM billing in the middle of a billing month without changing the billing cycle, so my first month&rsquo;s NEM bill only included 9 days, and so my first true-up period of 12 bills is only 11 1/3 months or 345 days. Presumably, future true-up periods will be a full year.<a href="#fnref:9" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are the stats on my cellular data usage over one year on Sprint&rsquo;s
network<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. (I got the phone on Halloween of 2011, and took this screenshot on
Halloween of 2012.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67861147@N00/8163380863"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7120/816338086%0A3_21996345ca.jpg" alt="1 year of cellular data usage" /></a></p>

<p>7 GB down and 1 GB up; 8 GB total; that averages to 666 MB per month. Clearly
I&rsquo;m not a heavy cellular data user and not making the most out of Sprint&rsquo;s
unlimited data allotment; this would fit comfortably within the other
carriers&#8217; smallest real<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> data plans (1GB/month).</p>

<p>Speaking of unlimited data plans: this might sound heretical to some, but I
really wouldn&rsquo;t mind metered data at a fair price. Say a penny a megabyte,
billing you only for what you use. That comes out to $10 per gigabyte, which
is actually the marginal rate that AT&amp;T and Verizon are charging now anyway,
except first they make you pay a minimum $30/month commitment and then they
round up to the next gigabyte.</p>

<p>Of course, I also wouldn&rsquo;t mind an unlimited plan that was cheap and fast and
allowed tethering<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, here in the US we have Sprint offering unlimited data at a
price that&rsquo;s fair for heavy users but not especially cheap for light users,
and their network isn&rsquo;t the fastest and they have surcharge for tethering.
Then we have AT&amp;T and Verizon saying unlimited plans don&rsquo;t incent them to
invest in their networks so they&rsquo;ve moved to metered plans; on the plus side
their networks have gotten markedly faster and they don&rsquo;t charge extra for
tethering on the metered plans; however their metering methods don&rsquo;t meet my
definition of fair.</p>

<p>Actually 11 1/2 months on Sprint&rsquo;s network, and 10 days on O2 Ireland and 3 days on Three UK during a trip to Europe. Both of their data networks, but especially Three&rsquo;s, were better than what I&rsquo;m accustomed to in the USA, which is especially infuriating given they&rsquo;re also much cheaper.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve updated my <a href="http://www.maddogsw.com/evernote-utilities/evernote-palm-importer/">utility for importing notes from Palm Desktop into
Evernote</a>
again.</p>

<p>The big change is that it now uses <a href="http://dev.evernote.com/documentation/cloud/chapters/Authentication.ph%0Ap">OAuth for authentication to the Evernote s
ervice</a>, instead of asking you for Evernote account credentials directly. This is a
step forward in general; utilities like this one shouldn&rsquo;t have unrestricted
access to your entire account, nor should they know your actual password in
case you use the same password for other services<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/tech/2012/11/01/third-party-authentication-%0Atransition-to-oauth-complete/">Evernote has disabled
username/password logins for third party
apps</a> to force them to use OAuth, a move which I
think more services should make<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I also made some smaller changes to further improve the chance of success for
people outside the USA, using nondefault character encoding or locale
settings.</p>

<p>Finally, I added the <a href="https://github.com/metamatt%0A/evernote-palmimport">public source repository</a> to my github account. (I&rsquo;ve always made the source code
for the current version available, but now the complete repository with
history is public.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I worked on my high school paper, I spent many hours working on the
newsroom Macs, but I had a Windows machine at home, and I was pretty
comfortable going back and forth. I noticed a few people who had more trouble:
Windows users who would swear a Mac would crash as soon as they touched it,
and symmetrically, Mac users who if using a Windows machine would crash it
right away.</p>

<p>This was in the bad old days of Windows 3.1 and System 7, before MMUs and
memory protection, and crashing neither OS was particularly hard or uncommon.
Still, there seemed to be something to this cross-platform-and-crash
phenomenon. A friend and I came up with a half-serious theory that these
crashes had to do with natural rhythms of human-user activity — mouse and
keyboard input would arrive and trigger interrupts and Mac OS and Windows
might have different preferences for the intervals between these interrupts
where certain rhythms would trigger race conditions just so, and kaboom, while
other rhythms would dance around the same bugs without triggering them. And,
the theory went, people would subconsciously learn what sequences of inputs
would crash their computer, learn to avoid those patterns, and compute along
happily on whichever platform they&rsquo;d learned to get along with: then upon
trying the other platform, kaboom again.</p>

<p>It was with this in mind that I read <a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/2012/10/surface-impressions/">John Moltz&rsquo;s impressions of Microsoft
Surface</a>. He&rsquo;s
generally pretty fair about giving it a chance, but then he dings it for
screen-rotation flakiness:</p>

<blockquote><p>Once when I set it down the screen orientation was upside down and it didn’t
seem to realize it. I had to pick it up and turn it over and then back again
to get it the right way.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that happened, but hey, every Apple device with automatic rotation
(iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad) I&rsquo;ve ever owned occasionally does that too. Come to
think of it, so do the various digital cameras I&rsquo;ve owned (from Canon, Nikon
and Panasonic). I can&rsquo;t think of anything that has a similar feature that I
haven&rsquo;t seen flake out that way.</p>

<p>But maybe if I could just learn to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=holding+it+wrong">hold it
right</a>…</p>
