  <div class="entry-content"><p>After watching a bunch of aquatic mammals (seals, sea lions, dolphins, and
whales) in Patagonia, Vanessa and I got curious about a suddenly obvious
question: how do they sleep in the water, when they need to breathe air?</p>

<p>It turns out the answer is different for the cetaceans (whales, dolphins,
porpoises) who spend their entire lives in the water, and the pinnipeds (seals
and sea lions), which are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped">technically only semi-
aquatic</a>.</p>

<p>Back to the real marine mammals, the cetaceans, <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-do-whales-and-%0Adolphin">the answer is a lot more
complex than I&#8217;d originally
suspected</a> &#8211; not only do they need to come to the surface to find air to
breathe, but their breathing system is under conscious control (unlike, say,
humans). So they can&#8217;t ever become completely unconscious and continue
breathing; also there are times when they can&#8217;t stop swimming without sinking.
Instead, they continue swimming while sleeping, and are able to sleep with
half their brain and body at a time, while the other half remains awake.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lightroom loves to lose keyboard focus when you&#8217;re typing in iptc fields in
the metadata editor in the right panel, especially on slow netbook &#8211; select a
bunch of images, change one field for all of them, press Tab, keep typing in
the 2nd field, a second or two later it&#8217;ll decide to commit the first edits
and yank focus away from the text field and then apply the rest of your
keypresses as LR keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve noticed this bug in LR 2.x and 3.x, and again, it&#8217;s especially easy to
trigger on a slow Windows netbook.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are a few US-centric websites that I want to use while traveling, which
work suboptimally from outside the US.</p>

<p>Obvious examples are Netflix (watch instantly) and Rhapsody, which probably
have license agreements restricting their use to inside the US. If you try to
browse these sites from a non-US IP address, they&#8217;ll just tell you to go away.</p>

<p>A less obvious example is PayPal; they work from outside the US but tend to
paranoia about dirty foreign hackers stealing access to your account. At
least, when I logged into my own account from Turkey, I found it locked into
&#8220;limited&#8221; mode, and after I jumped through the hoops to prove I was the real
owner and get the limitations removed, then went to Argentina, I immediately
found the account limited again the first time I logged in. All in all, it
seems easiest to let PayPal think I&#8217;m always in the US.</p>

<p>I understand why these sites have these behaviors based on location, but it&#8217;s
not what I want for me &#8211; I&#8217;m paying the same fees for the use of these sites
regardless of where I am; it seems silly to enforce artificial geographic
boundaries on the Internet.</p>

<p>So, I run an http proxy (tinyproxy) on a computer I control in the US, and
when I&#8217;m out of the US, I proxy use of these sites through that computer.</p>

<p>In practice there are a couple steps to this:</p>

<p>1) install tinyproxy somewhere</p>

<p>2) lock it down so only you can use it; you don&#8217;t want random people using it
(you might be paying for bandwidth, it might slow down your connection, and if
Netflix/Rhapsody/PayPal see too much traffic from it they might figure out
what you&#8217;re up to and block it). You could try to lock it down by IP but if
you&#8217;re traveling your IP address will change all the time; you could try to
set up authentication but I haven&#8217;t bothered to look what authentication
mechanisms are available to both tinyproxy and the browsers I care about and
whether they&#8217;re secure. Instead, I already have an all-purpose authentication
mechanism I like, openssh &#8211; so I set up an ssh tunnel with a local port
forwarded to the proxy port, and I just set tinyproxy to accept connections
only from localhost.</p>

<p>3) set your browser to use the proxy. Since proxied browsing relies on me
starting the ssh tunnel, might be slightly slower, and in some cases I do want
sites to be able to correctly geolocate me, I don&#8217;t want this to be the
default. I could turn the proxy on and off depending on what I&#8217;m browsing, but
that&#8217;s a pain. Instead, since I have multiple browsers installed, I just leave
one set without a proxy for normal use, and another one configured with the
proxy for the sites that need it. (I wonder if there are extensions for Chrome
or Firefox that allow you to configure per-site proxies?)</p>

Transportation Security Administration screeners checking passengers at

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;re in coastal Patagonia with the hopes of seeing penguins, dolphins, and
whales &#8211; all of which should be around this time of year. There are two big
wildlife reserves here &#8211; Peninsula Valdes to the north (known for whales and
elephant seals) and Punta Tombo to the south (the world&#8217;s largest colonly of
Magellanic Penguins). We&#8217;ve also been told there are good dolphin-watching
opportunities nearby, and we should try to combine this into our trip to the
penguin reserve.</p>

<p>Short story for those just interested in the animals: we saw the penguins and
dolphins and both were endearing. The dolphins we saw are Commerson&#8217;s
dolphins, which are tiny, live here year around, and are called &#8220;toninas&#8221; by
the Argentinians; other larger dolphin species (&#8220;delfines&#8221;) show up in the
summer but aren&#8217;t here yet. The toninas were easy to spot, and obligingly
playful, swimming near our boat, and surfing the bow waves from our and other
boats. The penguins in the Punta Tombo colony are Magellanic penguins, about 2
feet tall, fairly lazy, and fairly willing to ignore humans traipsing through
their nesting areas. We spent a few hours watching them, sleeping in their
nests, standing up and stretching and standing still for 10s of minutes at a
time, going through a wake-up grooming ritual that looks a lot like humans
brushing their teeth &#8211; hey, penguins are easy to anthropomorphize &#8211; and
occasionally waddling around.</p>

<p>Longer story with advice for anyone who might be trying this trip themselves:</p>

<p>The guidebooks we&#8217;re using are both heavily biased towards using Puerto Madryn
as a base for visiting these areas, but we decided to stay in Trelew first,
for three reasons: it&#8217;s closer to the penguin reserve, it&#8217;s got the airport
we&#8217;re flying into, and being less recommended by guidebooks it&#8217;ll be less full
of guidebook-toting tourists.</p>

<p>So, then, here we are in Trelew trying to figure out how best to visit Punta
Tombo, but this turns out to be not incredibly obvious, either from guidebook
advice or internet searches (hmm, maybe this is why the guidebooks advise
going to Puerto Madryn).</p>

<p>It seems we have 3 basic options: a guided tour package, a taxi hired for the
day, or renting a car and going by ourselves. The taxi that picked us up from
the airport mentioned they do all-day tours to Punta Tombo for a fixed price
of AR$480, so that&#8217;s our starting point.</p>

<p>Looking for tours, it seems like most of what&#8217;s available starts in Puerto
Madryn and not Trelew. Using guidebook advice, we find one company starting in
Trelew but they&#8217;re not running a tour today. Finally our hotel front desk
finds one; it&#8217;s AR$180 per person, and visits the penguin reserve, Gaiman for
Welsh tea, and the dinosaur museum. So a group tour: nearly the same price,
takes us other places we didn&#8217;t want to go, doesn&#8217;t visit the dolphins, and
leaves only about 1 hour with the penguins.</p>

<p>We ruled out renting a car because I didn&#8217;t feel like driving all day.</p>

<p>That left us back with the taxi option, and since now we know it doesn&#8217;t cost
that much more than a package tour (for 2 people &#8211; and for 3 or 4 people, it
would actually be cheaper), plus lets us go at our own pace, stay with the
penguins as long as we want, and work the dolphins into the itinerary too,
it&#8217;s the clear winner.</p>

<p>Next up: bus to Puerto Madryn, rent a car, and drive into Peninsula Valdes to
see the whales and elephant seals.</p>
