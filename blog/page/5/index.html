  <div class="entry-content"><p>After <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2012/01/20%0A/nothing-is-as-easy-as-it-should-be-ssd-upgrades/">the SSD upgrade project</a>, I now have a stack of
unused 1TB hard drives. I also have an old NAS unit (ReadyNAS NV) which is
currently hosting 4 320GB hard drives, is almost full, and while old is still
compatible with the 1TB drives. Sounds like a good match — time to upgrade.</p>

<p>Reading about <a href="http://www.readynas.com/?cat=54">ReadyNAS&#8217; vaunted X-RAID
technology</a>, a proprietary extension to RAID
that allows resizing, this sounds easy — one by one, replace each drive with a
larger one, and wait for the RAID to rebuild onto the new drive. When the
drives are different sizes, the array will be limited to 4x the size of the
smallest, but after upgrading all 4 to 1TB, I simply reboot and will have
access to the full new size. And since the ReadyNAS supports hot swap and has
the drives mounted in nice hot swappable sleds, I don&#8217;t even have to reboot
except for that final resize (and I&#8217;m not really clear on why I have to then,
but whatever).</p>

<p>Sounds easy… until I actually try swapping out the drives. The drives are in
sleds, see, and the sleds have this latch, and the latch has this release
button… and nothing happens when I press the release button. I try reading the
manual, which talks about how easy it is to add drives but doesn&#8217;t go into any
details on what to do if you have trouble removing one. I try reading &#8221;<a href="http://www.readynas.com/?page_id=193">The
definitive guide to the ReadyNAS NV+</a>&#8221;
(a slightly newer but very similar model) for tips; it talks about how disk
replacement eases the stress of disk failure; my mind jumps to bad puns about
stressing the ease while easing the stress, and thinking I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not
dealing with the stress of a failed disk that I can&#8217;t remove.</p>

<p>Eventually I find a <a href="http://www.readynas.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=30550">forum thread on the
problem</a>, with the
solution. It&#8217;s 5.5 years old, and still kicking. Much like my ReadyNAS NV, I
suppose.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I bought two <a href="http://www.nest.com/living-with-%0Anest/">Nest Learning Thermostats</a> for my house, which has two furnaces. Here&#8217;s how they&#8217;re working out
for me.</p>

<p><strong>Ordering</strong></p>

<p>I almost bought them on the day they were announced back in November, but
dithered, and the initial batch sold out; I got on the waiting list and
waited. In early January they sent me an email allowing me to place an order
(for up to 5 units); I ordered two; they arrived Friday and I&#8217;ve spent the
weekend playing (er, working) with them.</p>

<p>One thing that happened between when I didn&#8217;t order them the first day and
when my turn to order came around was <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/12/17%0A/nest-incompatibility-without-c-wire">Marco Arment&#8217;s post on Nest
incompatibility with his existing wiring</a>. Having read that, I semi-carefully
checked my own wiring against Nest&#8217;s online compatibility wizard before
ordering (which I might not have bothered doing if I hadn&#8217;t read Marco&#8217;s post,
given that my furnaces and wiring are only 3 years old, so I assumed they&#8217;re
modern). When I say &#8220;semi-carefully&#8221;, I mean I looked at my wires and verified
them against Nest&#8217;s tool (which says I&#8217;m fine), and I considered Marco&#8217;s
problem (2 wires, red and white, are enough for a basic thermostat to control
heating, but not to power or recharge the thermostat without activating said
heating) and made sure I had a 3rd wire and figured I wouldn&#8217;t have that
problem.</p>

<p>In fact, when my thermostats arrived and I installed them, I also uttered a
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/metamatt/status/157882839508062209">triumphant but premature
tweet</a> about having
modern wiring. If only. If you&#8217;re reading carefully — more carefully than I
had read Marco&#8217;s post — you&#8217;ll note I said I had 3 wires, but not which 3
wires. And, as it turns out, I had it wrong. No, I didn&#8217;t have a C (common)
wire; my third wire was a G (fan) wire.</p>

<p><strong>Unboxing and setup</strong></p>

<p>The packaging is nice; the actual thermostat unit is nice; the base which you
attach to the wall has a built-in level, and pressure-fit connectors for the
wires instead of screw terminals. It&#8217;s obvious the device was carefully
designed and built without taking shortcuts — which had better be true, given
the price.</p>

<p>It was fairly easy to take my old thermostat off the wall, note how it was
using the wires, reconnect the same wires (Rh, W and G, again) in the same
capacity to the Nest base, attach the Nest base to the wall, and then press
the Nest device onto the base. It didn&#8217;t take long to do this twice, in fact —
once upstairs and once downstairs.</p>

<p>The next step is to connect the thermostat my Wi-Fi network — entering Wi-Fi
passwords on small devices without keyboards is usually no fun, but entering
text on the Nest&#8217;s rotating dial is surprisingly satisfying. Kind of like
using a combination lock from high school again, but less confusing. As soon
as it connected to the network, the Nest found itself a software update,
invoking the download-and-reboot cycle that&#8217;s the bane of many modern smart
devices. In fact, it seemed to reboot twice. The downstairs device survived
this fine and next wanted me to join it to a cloud management account; the
upstairs device asked me what time it was, which is a bad sign for something
that&#8217;s supposed to be connected to the internet. It turns out it had forgotten
how to connect to the network, so I had to enter my Wi-Fi password again.</p>

<p>After this setup phase — which took a little longer than I&#8217;d expected due to
all that rebooting — the thermostats were active, ready to use manually, and,
ostensibly, learning my habits so I don&#8217;t need to tell them what to do.</p>

<p><strong>Use</strong></p>

<p>These thermostats are easy on the eyes and easy to use; you just turn the dial
to change the temperature, or push in on the dial to bring up the onscreen UI
with easy-to-understand options for setting home/away, turning the whole thing
off, or invoking manual scheduling settings I haven&#8217;t bothered playing with.</p>

<p>If you create a Nest account and install the smartphone app or use their
website, you can monitor and change the temperature from anywhere, which is
pretty darn space age if you ask me.</p>

<p>One minor glitch is that the just-approach-to-wake-screen feature seems to
only sometimes work; the Nest is supposed to recognize when you approach and
greet you by turning on the screen, but sometimes it doesn&#8217;t turn on until I
actually touch it, sometimes it only turns in when I stick my hand within
inches, and sometimes it turns on when I just walk by. This would be a minor
annoyance, but it also makes me wonder how well the auto-away feature will
work, since that&#8217;s also based on a proximity sensor (maybe the same one, maybe
a different one, I don&#8217;t know).</p>

<p>Two simple things my old, not-worth-blogging-about thermostat did that the
Nest doesn&#8217;t: show you the time on the main screen (my wife and I are used to
using the thermostat as a clock on our way out the door, as it&#8217;s conveniently
located for that) and remind you to change the furnace filters. Oh well, not a
dealbreaker, and maybe these features will appear in a future software update.</p>

<p>One design deficiency that wouldn&#8217;t be worth complaining about with any other
thermostat, but is noteworthy with the Nest now that they&#8217;re trying to apply
good design to elevate thermostats to the level of art object: off-angle
viewing of the display is terrible. It looks great from straight on, but
thermostats are usually mounted at chest level, not at eye level, and used
from fairly close by, so in normal use I&#8217;m looking down at the display at a
fairly steep angle. Part of the problem is the LCD display itself, and part of
the problem is the convex lens sitting over it; it&#8217;s really not putting its
best face forward in actual use.</p>

<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>

<p>The second day after I installed the two Nests, I heard a clicking sound
coming from the heating ducts. Upon inspection, the downstairs furnace was
working fine, but the upstairs furnace was making the clicking noises, which
were resonating through the ducts. I fiddled with the thermostat; it wanted
the furnace on but it wouldn&#8217;t come on. I turned the thermostat off; the
clicking stopped. I turned the thermostat back on, and it turned on the
furnace for about a minute, then the furnace turned off and went back to
clicking. I fiddled with the thermostat for a while longer, and was able to
provoke various permutations of this behavior, but not a working upstairs
furnace.</p>

<p>I called Nest support, and got a really helpful and knowledgeable guy who
suggested I swap the upstairs and downstairs units, to help rule out a problem
with the thermostat itself. After the swap, I still had problems upstairs and
not downstairs — apparently the problem is with the furnace, and not the
specific Nest unit. His hypothesis was that my furnace was so sensitive to
voltage that it would work fine if the thermostat just bridges the Rh and W
wires, but if the thermostat pulls any power at all from those wires, the
furnace relays get confused and start toggling instead of staying on. Just for
fun, I measured the wiring at both thermostats with a multimeter and couldn&#8217;t
detect much difference between upstairs and downstairs (in both cases, the
multimeter saw 28 V across Rh and W with the thermostat detached and the
furnace not running, and 0.485 A across Rh and W with the furnace running),
but the Nest&#8217;s built-in technical details monitoring report claimed voltage
dropped from 29 V upstairs when not running the furnace to 7.77 V when running
the furnace (and compared to 9.19 V downstairs). Is that 1.4 V difference
enough to explain why one would work and the other wouldn&#8217;t? I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>When I called back to Nest support with these results, the tech support guy
said this sounds like a power stealing problem and the probable solution is to
run a C wire. I asked why two nearly identical (same model, different size)
furnaces that are only 3 years old would be different in this regard, and he
didn&#8217;t really know.</p>

<p>Note this isn&#8217;t the same problem Marco wrote about, though I&#8217;d likely have
that problem over time too; his problem happens if the furnace doesn&#8217;t run
very often and the Nest needs to charge itself without running the furnace; in
my case the fully charged Nest couldn&#8217;t even run the furnace when it should be
on.</p>

<p><strong>Gripes</strong></p>

<p>Beyond the fact that the thermostat can&#8217;t run one of my furnaces, it&#8217;s
annoying that the <a href="http://store.nest.com/#compatibility">Nest compatibility
tool</a> doesn&#8217;t even warn of this problem.</p>

<p>A few other things that came up with I was on the support call: first, when I
was first describing the problem and giving information on how I&#8217;d connected
the Nest et cetera, I asked if they were already collecting diagnostic
information in the cloud since the thermostat is smart and internet-connected,
and was told no. I find that surprising and disappointing — a missed
opportunity. (There&#8217;s maybe a privacy concern, and I don&#8217;t want them selling
data on how often I run my furnace or how often I&#8217;m home vs away, but I
certainly wouldn&#8217;t mind them collecting diagnostics to improve their product.)</p>

<p>Also while chatting with the support tech, I asked if there was a way to get
the Nest to display a clock on the main screen, and to remind me when to
change the furnace filter, and was told no on both accounts; then I asked if I
could file a feature request for those and was told that not only do they not
take feature requests from customers, but that the support techs are
prohibited from talking to the product designers, both for legal/intellectual
property reasons. I joked that this must be because Nest was founded by people
from Apple — famous for not being persnickety about taking ideas from people
who might then claim ownership of said ideas; what can you say about a company
with an official &#8221;<a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/policies/ideas.html">unsolicited idea submission
policy</a>&#8221;? — and he said yeah,
if you read our privacy policy it has a lot in common with Apple&#8217;s. But come
on. It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s any intellectual property in the idea of a
thermostat displaying the time of day. And more than that: a policy that says
a company can&#8217;t listen to its customers is a customer-hostile policy.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>Basically, to get the Nest working with my upstairs furnace, I need to give it
a C wire. I did consider running new thermostat control wiring, but when I
looked at where the wires run, it&#8217;s not worth the trouble — there&#8217;s no way to
rerun the wires without opening walls.</p>

<p>But. What&#8217;s this G wire for, anyway? Following the <a href="http://%0Awiki.xtronics.com/index.php/Thermostat_signals_and_wiring#Heating">Transtronics wiki</a> Marco
linked to, and confirmed by observation, the thermostat doesn&#8217;t need to tell
the fan when to run while heating — I have gas heating and the furnace itself
controls the fan. Now, the thermostat can also tell the fan to run without the
heat, and it turns out that&#8217;s all the G wire is good for. After checking with
my wife, I confirmed we almost never use that feature (and it was relatively
easy to access before, with a switch on our old thermostats, whereas with the
Nest it requires digging through the settings menu a bit, so we&#8217;re even less
likely to do it).</p>

<p>Thus, the solution: repurpose the G wire as a C wire. We don&#8217;t really need
direct control over the fan, and if I do, I can run new wiring for that, to
locations that aren&#8217;t as hard to get to as the thermostat locations. (Note
that this works for me because we have gas heat; electric heaters don&#8217;t
control the fan themselves, so removing the G wire would not be a good idea.)
So, I had to turn off the furnace and reconnect the green wire on that end
too, moving it from the G terminal to the C terminal. This quick-and-dirty
solution satisfies my hacker instincts, and after a couple days of use, the
Nest is much happier: the Nest&#8217;s voltage monitoring reports 36 V at 100 mA,
instead of 8 V at 20 mA without the C wire, and the furnace runs when it
should.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>I like it; I&#8217;ll keep mine.</p>

<p>But based on my experience, I can&#8217;t recommend the Nest thermostat unless you
can give it a C wire. And I&#8217;m disappointed that all the information Nest will
give you before buying doesn&#8217;t point out even a whiff of such problems.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Nest support <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nest/status/160464579711877120">tweeted me back</a> to say they&#8217;ve updated the compatibility tool with a note about the C wire, but in my opinion <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2012/01/20/nest-c-wire-update/">it&#8217;s still buried where it&#8217;s too easy to miss</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2012/01/20/nest-%0Alearning-thermostat-review/">Nest thermostat review</a> complained about up-front lack of obviousness
about &#8220;C&#8221; wire compatibility issues, and Nest support <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nest/status/160464579711877120">replied with a
tweet</a> saying</p>

<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve updated the compatibility tool so there&#8217;s a note about C wire, but
you&#8217;re right - it could be clearer.</p></blockquote>

<p>I took a trip back through the compatibility wizard, and (unless there are
more changes coming) it&#8217;s there but it&#8217;s still not obvious.</p>

<p>First, I tell it what I&#8217;ve got:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7001/6733277723_e2c7b691a7_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then, it tells me what to expect:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7167/6733277795_b182cdd286_z.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;m compatible, no reservations, it says. Unless I click through the &#8221;<a href="http://support.nest.com/customer/portal/articles/285077">Learn
more</a>&#8221; link, which
from the context sounds like it&#8217;s going to help me decide whether I can
install it without help, not whether it&#8217;s compatible with my wiring. That link
goes to a &#8221;<a href="http://support.nest.com/customer/portal/articles/285077">Does Nest need a common
wire?</a>&#8221; article,
which has some useful information, including recognition of the possible
problem, a suggestion to do what I did (turn another wire into a C wire if
possible), and a link to <a href="http://support.nest.com/customer/portal/articles/197951-when-nest-%0Aneeds-a-common-wire">even more
details</a>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the right information, but I wouldn&#8217;t expect to find it hidden behind
that &#8220;Learn more&#8221; link, and I still think anyone who clicks through the
compatibility wizard without a C wire should see it. Maybe these problems are
rarer than my small sample size indicates, but on the other hand, this &#8220;power
stealing&#8221; problem doesn&#8217;t seem like an easy one.</p>

<p>C&#8217;mon, Nest — I like the product, and now that I&#8217;ve got mine working, I expect
to remain a happy customer. But for an issue this subtle and important, I
think you&#8217;d do well to err on the side of caution.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Seems like spammers are taking to spamming weblog comments wherever they are
allowed with innocuous-looking content-free posts just to link back to
themselves. (Is this somewhere between spam and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacn">bacn</a>, since it&#8217;s not quite spam? I was
unsure at first, but now I think it&#8217;s just spam.)</p>

<p>Typically these posts will be written in a fairly reasonable facsimile of
English, and not overtly spammy — a bunch of compliments I&#8217;m almost
egotistical enough to believe, except there&#8217;s no relation to the post they&#8217;re
commenting on, and somewhere at the end, a link to some site they&#8217;re pimping.</p>

<p>These range from the fairly obvious link</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7163/6729985265_71906afdc5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>to a link trying to masquerade as a signature</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7155/6729985235_df30215312.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>to links only in the author&#8217;s name</p>

<p>and for a final really blatant example, there&#8217;s this guy:</p>

<p>These last ones might actually require more than 2 seconds of thought to
recognize as spam, if they didn&#8217;t appear in batches of 8 on the same post.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I just delete all these, except for the Tumblr &#8220;like&#8221; spam
which I don&#8217;t know how to target directly. (The next step would be turning off
both comments and Tumblr &#8220;notes&#8221; in the theme, which would make these problems
go away entirely.)</p>

<p>The ironic thing is these people are probably doing this for Google link
juice, but the way comments work via Disqus, it&#8217;s all Javascript and not in
the real HTML as the page loads anyway, so I doubt indexers follow it. Plus I
just delete it anyway. Spammers, if you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;re just wasting
your time and mine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re a Gmail user, you&#8217;ve already got cloud email, a contact list or
address book, and a calendar (actually a set of calendars) hosted by Google.
And if you have an iPhone, you want to connect the built-in email, contacts
and calendar applications to those Google data sources.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s possible, but it&#8217;s not as easy as it should be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not easy&#8221;, you&#8217;re thinking? Go to Settings, &#8220;Mail, Contacts, Calendars&#8221;, &#8220;Add
Account&#8221;, and there&#8217;s Gmail — enter your credentials, the account is set up,
what could be easier than that?</p>

<p>Well, that isn&#8217;t hard, but it also doesn&#8217;t work very well. If you use the
&#8220;Gmail&#8221; account type, it doesn&#8217;t sync contacts at all. Email is there, via
IMAP, but Gmail via IMAP has some notable deficiencies: push email doesn&#8217;t
work (so the iPhone doesn&#8217;t see new mail or other changes right away), the
delete behavior is weird, and there&#8217;s this extra &#8220;All Mail&#8221; folder which might
sync an extra copy of all your messages. Your calendars are there &#8211; well, by
default, only the main calendar, and not any others you may have created, or
calendars others have shared with you, or delegated/published calendars like
the one TripIt can automatically publish your travel plans to. (<a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=151674">You can fix
this with an extra
step</a>, after
which multiple calendars work normally.)</p>

<p>There&#8217;s another way: add your Google account using the &#8220;Microsoft Exchange&#8221;
account type. (If this seems confusing, note that what this really means is to
access Google&#8217;s data services using the Exchange ActiveSync, or EAS, protocol,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveSync">which Microsoft has licensed to both Apple and Google among
others</a>. Even more confusing, Google
brands this method of access to its services not as Exchange or EAS, but as
&#8221;<a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/sync/">Google Sync</a>&#8221;. Whatever.)</p>

<p>If you do this, things get quite a bit better: contacts sync to the phone;
email gains push (and in my opinion, the folder list and delete button work
better). This is actually t<a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=138740">he method Google recommends for use with
iOS</a>. Again,
only the main calendar syncs to the phone, but again, <a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=139206">there&#8217;s a way to enable
the other
calendars</a>,
which is even more of a pain than the CalDAV method.</p>

<p>(Aside: I think the ability to get multiple calendars via Google Sync and EAS
was recently added, because when I first set up my iPhone I couldn&#8217;t find this
method, and resorted to adding my Gmail account twice: once using the
&#8220;Exchange&#8221; account type for email and contacts with calendars disabled, and
once using the &#8220;Gmail&#8221; account type for calendars with email disabled. This no
longer seems necessary, but it may be a useful tip for anyone who wants Google
contacts synced to their phone but for whatever reason don&#8217;t like the
EAS/Google Sync behavior for email or calendars.)</p>

<p>You may also run into some problems with contact sync, documented on the
&#8221;<a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?answer=139635">Google Sync known issues with
iOS</a>&#8221; page,
under &#8220;Limited Contact Information&#8221;: &#8220;Phone number synchronization is limited
to 2 Home numbers, 1 Home Fax, 1 Mobile, 1 Pager, 3 Work (one will be labeled
&#8216;Company Main&#8217;) and one Work Fax number.&#8221; Another problem <strong>not</strong> described
here is that phone numbers not exactly matching the expected labels (which are
case sensitive) will not sync: I had dozens of friends who in in my Google
contacts list had their mobile phone number labeled as &#8220;Mobile&#8221; instead of
&#8220;mobile&#8221;, and these people showed up on my iPhone with no phone number at all.</p>

<p>The end result is that it&#8217;s possible to make iOS and Google accounts play
nicely together, but it requires some up front knowledge, some extra steps in
account step on the iOS device, and some extra massaging of, potentially,
every entry in your address book to make sure the expected phone numbers sync.</p>

<p>Is it possible to do better than this? Sure. The late
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS">webOS</a> synced all my Google data (email,
calendars and contacts) easily with no extra setup beyond choosing the Gmail
account type and adding my credentials. Presumably Android is capable of
similarly smooth integration. Apple may not be interested in smoothing the
process in iOS because they&#8217;re wary of Google&#8217;s dominance and want to push
<a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">their own cloud data services</a>, but given the
number of people who use both Gmail and iOS, I think they do their users a
disservice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apple recently added two new features to iTunes: &#8221;<a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/features/">iTunes in the
Cloud</a>&#8221;, which adds all your iTunes
music purchases to a cloud library which can be streamed or downloaded as
often as you want to any of your devices (iPhone, iPod, iPad, computer with
iTunes), and &#8220;iTunes Match&#8221;, which adds all the music you <em>didn&#8217;t</em> buy from
iTunes to that same cloud library, enabling all the same &#8220;iTunes in the Cloud&#8221;
features.</p>

<p>Apple is billing this primarily as a way to get your music from your iTunes
library onto your phone or iPad without having to plan ahead and pre-sync the
music onto the device.</p>

<p>However, in addition to using iCloud to sync music between devices, iTunes
Match also has another benefit: it syncs the library metadata between multiple
iTunes libraries that enable iTunes Match using the same account.</p>

<p>This subtle addition is actually something important that I&#8217;ve wanted from
iTunes as long as I&#8217;ve been using it: iTunes has a bunch of organization
features including smart playlists which work best if it knows what you listen
to and how much you like it. It tracks how many times you play each song and
allows you to rate songs, and it automatically syncs this between one iTunes
library and any connected iPods, but until now each iTunes library has been an
island: if you have two computers, say a desktop and a laptop, each has its
own library, with its own play counts and ratings and playlists, and its own
idea of your preferences, and any iPods or other Apple devices you have were
able to sync songs and metadata from a single one of these libraries.</p>

<p>Now, with iTunes Match enabled, all my computers with iTunes see the same
library — all of the songs on any one of them are synced up to iCloud and then
back to the other computers, and metadata including play counts, ratings and
playlists are also kept in sync. This joining of the libraries also means it
matters a lot less which of my computers I sync a given iPod with, since
effectively they all use the same library.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s one minor remaining annoyance given the way I use iTunes at home: I
have a file server with all my music, a Mac Mini in the living room which can
play music and movies, and my main desktop computer, and each of these Macs
uses the network file server for the music files instead of storing a local
copy. (My laptop spends enough time disconnected from the home network that it
does deserve a local copy of the music.) This means that if I add music to the
library on one of the desktop computers, it&#8217;s already accessible in the
expected location from any of the other computers that can access the file
server, though the other computers won&#8217;t know it until I tell iTunes to add
the files to the local library. The storage is shared; the library metadata is
still per-computer. Using iTunes Match, the libraries are kept in sync
automatically, but iTunes doesn&#8217;t notice that some of the files are magically
already local — it will show such files with the cloud icon, and offer to
stream them or download them even though that&#8217;s unnecessary. Streaming works
fine, and downloading works, but actually downloads the file to the same
folder, notices that the file already exists, and adds a numeric suffix to
make the filename unique.</p>

<p>It would be nice if there was a way to tell iTunes to notice local copies of
files that it thinks are only in iCloud. Also, I occasionally found myself
having downloaded extra copies of songs, noticing this cluttering up the music
folder, and deleting the extra files outside of iTunes (using Finder) — this
left me in a broken state where iTunes has an entry for the song in the
library, and the file exists in the filesystem and in iCloud, but iTunes
thinks it&#8217;s local so won&#8217;t stream or download from iCloud and thinks it has a
different name so it won&#8217;t play the local file, at which point things are
pretty broken. What&#8217;s needed here is a way to stuff the file back into the
cloud, making iTunes think there is no local copy so it will go get it from
iCloud again the next time it&#8217;s needed — I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to do this
until I read this <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/11/more-itunes-match-answers-%0Adj-sets-how-to-replace-music-and-more.ars,">Q&amp;A article at Ars
Technica</a> which has the secret: select the
song, hold the option key while pressing the delete key, and the normal delete
confirmation dialog will grow a new checkbox &#8220;also delete this song from
iCloud&#8221;. Leaving that option unchecked, you can delete the local copy of the
song (or, a broken link to a missing local copy of a song) while leaving it in
the cloud library, the cloud icon comes back, and iTunes will go back to
getting the data from iCloud as needed again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been wishing and waiting and watching and waiting, with an idea in my
head of what I want: from computers and the internet, regarding photos and
photo management, and connecting all the computers I use. Some of this is very
specific to photos, and some of this is general multi-computer file
management, and after years of watching and waiting, little of it is done the
way I wish it was.</p>

<p>I take photos with digital cameras. I want all of those photos accessible to
me wherever I go, on all the computers and smart devices I own and any I
happen to use temporarily; I want them backed up for safety; I want some of
them shared with my friends or the whole internet. In short: I want my
memories protected, accessible to me, and selectively shared with those I
choose to share them with.</p>

<p>There exist good file sync solutions, and there exist good backup solutions,
and there exist good photo sharing solutions, but all of them have drawbacks,
not least of which is that they&#8217;re separate and don&#8217;t really work together, so
I need to do more to get these combined benefits.</p>

<p>Ideally, I&#8217;d like all photos I take immediately uploaded to a private site in
the cloud, automatically, which acts as backup and also automatically syncs
them between all my devices, and which also offers a web interface capable of
giving me full access to the collection, and selecting some photos for sharing
in a nice way, with or without authentication.</p>

<p>Since upload bandwidth is generally too slow and expensive, I want the cloud
upload to happen once, automatically and asynchronously in the background, as
soon as possible; the photo is now backed up and syncable; if I choose to
share it, there&#8217;s no further waiting for upload.</p>

<p>I want flexible organization (which should work well with as much metadata as
I want to add, or as little), to scale to my collection of thousands of photos
over many years, and grow into the future. I want the sync solution to play
promiscuously well with other apps I choose to use, and not enforce a
particular filesystem or logical organization scheme, but I want it to offer
optional organization features which help me keep a well-groomed collection if
I can use the help. And the sync part of the solution means that any
organizational changes I make, on any connected device and in any app, is
reflected everywhere.</p>

<p>I want this to work with full-resolution photos, and raw photos, and I want it
to work with arbitrary metadata. And I want it to be promiscuously
crossplatform: on Mac and Windows and Linux desktops, and iOS and Android and
whichever other mobile platforms manage to prove their relevance.</p>

<p>I want the mobile device version to realize and revel in the constraints of
the platform, acknowledging that connectivity is ubiquitous but not always
fast or reliable, that memory is limited, and that snappy touch interactions
feel good. Thus, if I&#8217;m using a device that combines a camera and a network
interface (any smartphone) I want every photo I take immediately sent to the
cloud for backup and syncability. I also want my entire collection synced down
to my device as a photo wallet, but, acknowledging local storage limits, I
want this to automatically downscale to an appropriate resolution, and I want
to be able to select per-device subsets of the entire collection to subscribe
to.</p>

<p>It would be great if the sync/backup/share features work with non-photo files
&#8211; the solution I envision would be file-based, and have a bunch of special
sugar for image files, but would be useful even for other files &#8211; but that&#8217;s
not necessary. Non-photo files are already handled pretty well by services
like DropBox.</p>

<p>In fact, my continuing desire for the magic super photo cloud service is
driven by noting that by and large, photos are the only remaining file type I
have to really care about on my computer, meaning data I create that isn&#8217;t
already well handled by cloud services. Examples that are already well
handled: Email (tons of cloud services including Gmail);  office documents
(Google Docs); unstructured notes and clippings (Evernote); miscellaneous
files that don&#8217;t fall into the above buckets but are small (Dropbox): what&#8217;s
left? Well, photos, music and video. But music is a special beast, which like
photos also involves largish files but unlike photos is something I buy
instead of create, meaning any individual file I want already exists in some
canonical form I can get from lots of other sources; anyway it&#8217;s well handled:
Amazon, Apple, and Google have cloud sync; the file-based approach is somewhat
displaced by subscription services like Rhapsody and Spotify. Video is a
combination of photos and music which, in the case of video we record
ourselves, I think will end up having the same properties as photos: large
files we create, embodying our memories, that we want to sync and backup and
share. So it&#8217;s the photos we take (and by extension I include video we take)
that we care about managing with computers, better than it&#8217;s currently done.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a smattering of things that exist now, attacking some of the above
problems and illustrating a variety of different approaches. I&#8217;ll call out
what they do right, and what I find lacking:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> (file sync and then some): can do most of what I&#8217;m asking for, but it&#8217;s not photo-specific (which could be bug or feature or both). The price is high (compared to photo sharing and backup services which usually offer unlimited storage). They have a sharing UI which has been somewhat customized for photo albums, but it&#8217;s pretty bare bones compared to full-blown photo sharing sites. The syncing is good but not perfect; p2p sync first requires an upload to the cloud (so it makes you wait for the slow hop then skips the fast hop); it enforces a certain filesystem layout on computer clients; it doesn&#8217;t have an appropriate mode for syncing all photos to/from smart devices at suitable resolution. All this said, Dropbox is probably the closest existing thing to what I want, and it offers good 3rd party APIs allowing others to extend it &#8211; I think they see themselves more as storage infrastructure for the web than any specific application &#8211; so if the interoperability and pricing concerns don&#8217;t bother you, maybe it&#8217;s already the right answer.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/features/photo-stream.html">Photo Stream</a> (photo sync): gets the sync right (the first I&#8217;ve seen that automatically adds photos as they&#8217;re taken). However, it has very strict and arbitrary limits: no deletion, no organization, and includes only the last 1000 photos or 30 days, so it&#8217;s basically this write-only temporary repository that syncs across devices but which you need to manually fish the things you care about out of, and manage separately. It does have the magic auto-upload feature for network-connected cameras, and it does deal with RAW images. I see this as a promising demo of one aspect of what I&#8217;m looking for, but it doesn&#8217;t even touch the others (organization, backup, or sharing).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/carousel.html">Adobe Carousel</a> (photo sync and sharing): haven&#8217;t tried it yet, and it looks promising but with limited platform support and doesn&#8217;t handle raw files. Pricing may be a turnoff (monthly fee and limited number of carousels). Should handle sharing, both public and private. But not suitable for my entire photo library, as far as I can tell.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.crashplan.com/">CrashPlan</a> (online backup, also see Mozy, Carbonite, BackBlaze): cheap unlimited-size cloud backup, which can also let you retrieve individual files from the cloud via a web interface, which in a pinch means you can get at your files from anywhere. The web interface isn&#8217;t optimized for this case though, nor is it optimized for photo display, and there are no suitable features for sharing (albums, delegatable access control).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> (photo sharing): Flickr is great for photo hosting and sharing; it has great organizational features and a good community. The pro version offers effectively unlimited storage and has neat tracking features so you can see the popularity of what you post. However, Flickr doesn&#8217;t itself handle uploads or, really, client software in general, so it doesn&#8217;t handle sync (it does have an API with good 3rd party adoption, addressing this somewhat). It doesn&#8217;t handle RAW files, and it&#8217;s not suitable for backup. The sharing features allow flexible public and private sharing, but with not a lot of flexibility for album display. In general, the evolution of the site has been slow since Yahoo! bought them out. I think the site was originally designed with a forward-looking vision that in the near future, nobody would need any local photo software, and you could just upload everything to Flickr, edit and organize it there, share it there, and you wouldn&#8217;t need sync or backup. And maybe if the site had continued on its original trajectory and pace, this would have happened by now &#8211; but I find it&#8217;s anything but true in the real world.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> (photo sharing): Facebook has huge adoption, and I&#8217;ve found that photos I post there get seen (and &#8220;liked&#8221; and commented on) more than anywhere else, including Flickr. But, Facebook is a walled garden (it may be possible to use it for public photo sharing but I don&#8217;t see people doing that in practice); content hosted there is not search engine friendly; you as the photographer also get zero control over photo presentation, zero insight into who&#8217;s viewing your photos, and only very limited organizational features (albums with a size limit which can&#8217;t be nested hierarchically). Person tagging and automatic face recognition make up for some of this; general ease of use and speed and reach make Facebook a good solution for sharing your photos as long as your needs are simple; however on my list of big top-level wishes (handle sync, backup, and sharing) it only touches sharing, and honestly, given the limited control over organization and presentation, I&#8217;d prefer to use Flickr if I could get the same reach. Given the name of the site (it&#8217;s the book of faces, after all) and the mandate implied therein, I feel like they could take this feature much much farther, but it also seems like the backup/syncing aspect I want is not part of this &#8220;book of faces&#8221; mandate and cries out for a dedicated solution. Note that Facebook is free and offers unlimited storage (as far as I know); the platform scales well (and is, I believe, by far the world&#8217;s largest-volume photo server); it doesn&#8217;t handle RAW files, or even particularly high-resolution images.</li>
<li><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/">Google&#8217;s photo suite</a> (photo organization and sharing): Google has nice desktop client software for photo organization and editing (Picasa), which they eventually built an online companion for with sharing and automatic sync features (Picasaweb), and then integrated into their new social network, Google+. Taken together, this provides a pretty good start-to-finish solution for taking, editing, uploading, and sharing photos. However the upload/sync solution based on Picasa is not flexible or pervasive enough to serve as backup or sync files managed outside Picasa, and the website is certainly not designed to serve as a central hub for managing and syncing my entire photo library. I&#8217;m not even sure if the sync is bidirectional; it may be upload-only.</li>
<li><a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> (generic unstructured data sync): Evernote has a good web service, with client apps and a web app for access, automatic syncing for offline access, and attractive pricing. However it doesn&#8217;t offer any of the organization or sharing features you&#8217;d really want for photo management, nor does it integrate with other apps via the filesystem (stuff stored in and synced via Evernote is available via the Evernote API, but not via older integration points, namely local filesystems).</li>
<li>File sync in general: Beyond Dropbox, described above, I haven&#8217;t seen anything that really scratches this itch in the way I&#8217;m envisioning.</li>
<li>Photo sharing in general: there are tons more photo sharing services, but by and large, they have the same properties I ascribed to Flickr above, but are less good at it. You might have a favorite that you think I&#8217;m giving short shrift to here; fine; let me know if you know of any that are qualitatively better than Flickr on the list of things I&#8217;m wishing for in this post.</li>
<li>Other things not mentioned here: This list is intended to show examples, not be exhaustive, so I&#8217;ve collapsed whole categories onto one exemplar; for example, while I&#8217;m aware of SpiderOak and see it having certain advantages over Dropbox, for my purposes here it&#8217;s essentially the same. There are probably many other sync, backup and photo sharing services that have their own advantages but don&#8217;t break new ground on the aspects I care about; if you know about something I missed that does address my wish list, please let me know.</li>
</ul>


<p>How I&#8217;d build this: I&#8217;d want the following pieces:</p>

<ol>
<li>The central cloud service which stores files securely for backup, and handles sync to any clients I&#8217;ve authorized.</li>
<li>Client software for every platform which matters, which handles sync, automatically in the background: new files appearing first on this device are uploaded to the cloud service; new files announced from the cloud service are synced (at an appropriate resolution) down to this device&#8217;s local library; changes to existing files (including filesystem metadata like name and location, picture-specific metadata like that encoded in EXIF and IPTC mechanisms, and image data itself) are also automatically synced in both directions.</li>
<li>Web app atop the first cloud service which handles organization and management &#8211; letting me move files between folders or albums, apply tags, and designate what to share with whom.</li>
<li>Web app for sharing, pulling authorized files from the cloud service, and displaying them with nice presentation and according to whatever organization (individual file, album, by tag, etc) I&#8217;ve chosen.</li>
<li>Client local versions of #3 (optional and lower priority, since I should be able to use the web version or any local software I want to most things this could do).</li>
</ol>


<p>(I think Evernote, top to bottom, service to applications, is a great example
of this architecture &#8211; handling what they call &#8220;notes&#8221;, which basically means
document snippets with attachments &#8211; but, as described above, it doesn&#8217;t
solve my photo sync problem, since the client local apps don&#8217;t integrate my
local filesystem and provide an integration point for other local apps, and
the web interface doesn&#8217;t have theorganization and display features I&#8217;d want
for photos.)</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what this should cost or what I&#8217;d be willing to pay for it &#8211;
more than free (Google and Facebook); probably more than Flickr&#8217;s $25/year and
more than the unlimited backup companies&#8217; $5/month; probably less than
Dropbox&#8217;s per-GB-per-month fees. For this to be done right, the storage and
bandwidth would probably have significant cost, and most of the data is
private so can&#8217;t be de-duped.</p>

<p>Clearly this isn&#8217;t easy &#8211; the inherent challenges of handling and
transporting and scaling to this much data, and designing good interfaces for
all the services and applications, are real, and for anyone but the
incumbents, there are also the additional challenges of integrating with 3rd
party software and OS platforms, especially less open and less flexible mobile
platforms (given the sandboxing and multitasking restrictions in iOS, for
example, I&#8217;m not sure anyone but Apple is in a position to implement Photo
Stream for iOS right now).</p>

<p>But it would be nice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My first impressions after playing with the Kindle Fire for an hour or so:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>it&#8217;s basically a color, video-happy, app-happy Kindle.</p></li>
<li><p>fine for reading Kindle books, but if that&#8217;s what you want to do, the e-ink Kindles are cheaper, lighter, less distracting, and have much better battery life.</p></li>
<li><p>video playback from Amazon&#8217;s store or Netflix works great</p></li>
<li><p>app selection is small, but I&#8217;ll bet a lot of games show up soon/over time</p></li>
<li><p>overall touch interaction is ok but clunky, doesn&#8217;t quite feel right compared to iOS, scrolling is choppy, some touches aren&#8217;t recognized, some light touches send it scrolling for miles</p></li>
<li><p>web browser feels decidedly not as fast as this year&#8217;s Apple devices (iPad 2, iPhone 4S). So much for Silk?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, if you compare it head to head against an iPad 2, of course the iPad
comes out ahead, but it also costs 2.5x more, and is bigger and heavier. But
iOS still sets the standard for natural touch interaction, and iOS also has a
much wider app selection. Plus there&#8217;s more hardware packed into an iPad:
camera and GPS, and options for adding external keyboards, so some people even
find they can use it as a laptop replacement… anyway, I don&#8217;t see the Kindle
Fire having comparable versatility.</p>

<p>If you want to focus on reading, video and games, and you like the 7&#8221; size
(which is just right in many ways), the Kindle Fire is pretty compelling,
especially given the price.</p>

<p>I sure hope Amazon is rapidly improving the touch interaction via software
updates, though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wrote a <a href="http://blog.metamatt.com/blog/2011/11/17/kindle-fire-first-impressions/">semi-positive mini-review of the Kindle
Fire</a>
this morning.</p>

<p>Then I read <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/11/17/kindle-fire-review">Marco Arment&#8217;s rather scathing &#8220;human
review&#8221;</a>, and wondered:
wait a minute, if it&#8217;s that bad, should I return it, and wait for a better
version (or save my money if no better version materializes)?</p>

<p>The thing is, I saw most of the same things he did and had most of the same
complaints; I just expect Amazon to fix them. Marco sees the glass half-empty;
I see it half-full; maybe I&#8217;m too much of an optimist. I understand that it&#8217;s
smarter to buy something for or judge something on its current capabilities,
not ones that may or may not materialize in the future. Still, it seems worth
considering how much better the current generation hardware might be able to
get with software updates.</p>

<p>Most of the complaints centered around speed and touch interaction. And those
are legitimate &#8211; lots of taps are ignored; lots of taps are interpreted as
small drags from nowhere to nowhere; scrolling is chunky and jerky; it&#8217;s at
best annoying and far from a premium experience. For goodness sake, the orange
pointed stripe that you drag to unlock the device, every time you want to wake
it from sleep, doesn&#8217;t drag smoothly &#8211; it&#8217;s the first thing you see; how hard
is it to get that right? Still, if Amazon cares &#8211; and I hope they do &#8211; they
should be able to fix this.</p>

<p>So will they (fix it)? What&#8217;s the problem here, anyway? <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/5117/amazon-kindle-fire-tore-%0Adown-has-512mb-of-ram">The hardware should
be up to the task</a> &#8211;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_OMAP#OMAP_4"> TI OMAP 4430
SOC</a> with two
gigahertz CPU cores on Cortex A9 architecture and PowerVR SGX540 GPU, 512MB of
RAM. That compares favorably with this year&#8217;s Apple devices based on the A5
SOC (iPad 2, iPhone 4S: two comparable CPU cores and a somewhat newer GPU
core) and very favorably with last year&#8217;s Apple devices based on the A4 SOC
(iPhone 4 and 4th-generation iPod Touch: one comparable CPU core and a
somewhat older GPU core). I heard that <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/14/siegler-specs">specs are
dead</a>, but at least
this establishes a baseline. And note that at the Kindle Fire&#8217;s 1024x600
screen resolution, it&#8217;s pushing the exact same number of pixels as the 960x640
retina display in the iPhone 4 and 4S. So assuming they can figure out how to
effectively leverage the CPUs and GPU &#8211; I don&#8217;t know how good Android is at
this, and I don&#8217;t know what shortcuts Amazon took in forking Android, and so
on &#8211; you&#8217;d think they should be able to get iPhone 4S-like performance out of
this. At the very least they should be able to compete with the 4th-generation
iPod Touch (which is a year old and the same price). The point is that Amazon
and Apple (and everyone else too) are using similar guts, with similar-
architecture ARM CPU cores and PowerVR GPU cores. Right now, the iPod Touch is
night and day more responsive. Amazon, get cracking.</p>

<p>(I&#8217;ve owned the previous 2 generations of e-ink Kindle and Amazon delivered
significant software updates to these long after purchase; that gives me
reason to be hopeful the same applies to the Kindle Fire.)</p>

<p>Some of the complaints were about missing physical buttons &#8211; hardware volume
buttons would be nice, a dedicated home button would be nice, and there&#8217;s no
way to fix those problems in software. (The headphone complaints are also
legitimate; the headphone jack location is obviously not patchable in
software; the popping might be; however I don&#8217;t really care, because the iPod
has so won the music race that I don&#8217;t have any desire to use the Kindle Fire
for music. I do find it notable that pretty much every non-Apple multifunction
device that <em>can</em> play music takes it so unseriously that they have popping
problems like this; that&#8217;s par for the course with old and new Palm
smartphones too… oh well.)</p>

<p>What this boils down to is this: if Amazon can wring decent performance out of
the hardware, and pay some real attention to nitpicky details about the touch
interaction, about half of Marco&#8217;s (and my) complaints should go away. I see
no reason this is impossible to fix with the current hardware. However, if
they also decide to yield to common sense and add hardware home and volume
buttons, the first-generation units will forever feel lacking by comparison.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll close with a final note on why I&#8217;m willing to give the Kindle Fire some
slack. I&#8217;m not trying to compare the Kindle Fire and iPad or argue the Kindle
Fire kills or replaces anything else, much less the iPad. But I do think the
Kindle Fire has the right guts to deliver a much better experience than it
does today, and is fixable in software if Amazon has the will to improve it.
I&#8217;m also intrigued that there&#8217;s finally an Android competitor to the iPod
Touch &#8211; decent hardware sold contract-free and unsubsidized for an honest
$200. (Incidentally, that&#8217;s something <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/apples_pricing_advantage">John Gruber called out for
before</a>.) The big
difference between the Kindle Fire and the iPod Touch, other than the
operating system (and the responsiveness and app ecosystem that put Apple way
ahead on the software side) is obviously the size; I&#8217;m not going to get into
the screen size argument, other than to point out that anything that doesn&#8217;t
fit in a pocket is clearly less portable than anything that does, and that
size imposes so many tradeoffs there&#8217;s no one perfect size. Pick the one that
works for you.</p>

<p>Given that the $200 Android-based iPod Touch competitor now exists, I&#8217;m
interested to see what happens with the app ecosystem. I think it could be a
big gaming success, the way the iPod Touch has been, for example.</p>

<p>If Amazon can endow it with a major dose of missing snappiness, that is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the MMRF: They raised about $525K via this marathon, which is one third of
their overall events-based fundraising for the year. (And this year was a
record high.) $4300 of that was from you all, so one more big thank-you from
me, the MMRF, and the people they try to help.</p>

<p>For the marathon as a whole: Conditions were great, and the top 3 men all beat
the previous course record. You can find plenty of news stories on this if
you&#8217;re curious.</p>

<p>For me: I originally started training for this marathon (my first) with a goal
of finishing in under 4 hours, which is about 9 minutes per mile. Towards the
middle of my training, it became obvious that I&#8217;d be able to exceed that goal
and revised it to somewhere between a very optimistic 8 minutes per mile (3:30
total) to a more realistic 8:30 per mile (3:45 total). I ran with my friend
Jeff pacing me (he&#8217;s run a couple marathons before) and we set out with a goal
of starting with 8:30 miles and speeding up as we went.</p>

<p>Of course, at the beginning we felt great and it was hard to run the exact
speed we&#8217;d planned. We did the first 6 miles a little slower than 8 minutes,
then still felt strong so we sped up a little. Up through the first 16 miles
(which is right where the course enters Manhattan for the first time) I felt
great. At 16 miles I began to feel only good, but we kept the pace around 8
minutes per mile until mile 22, where a couple things happened: I began to
feel not great at all, there&#8217;s a very mild but very long uphill leading into
Central Park, and I decided I needed to slow down. Jeff stayed strong and went
on ahead; I slowed down by about a minute a mile, did the last 4 miles at
about a 9:30 pace, and finished in 3:37:19. (Jeff finished in 3:32:35, and I
say thanks to Jeff for pulling me along at a strong pace and congrats for
being able to stick it out the whole way.)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s funny, because during the first 16 miles I felt like I should go do this
every day, and during the last 4 miles I never wanted to do it again, and
after finishing, of course, my feelings (a little more detached and not in the
middle of a runner&#8217;s high or extreme pain) are somewhere in between. During
those last 4 miles, I knew I had to just keep slogging on to the finish; I
couldn&#8217;t quite keep the 8 minute pace but I knew I had to keep running;
slowing down any more wouldn&#8217;t have felt better; the only thing that would
have felt good at that point was quitting, and I knew that wasn&#8217;t an option,
not least because of yall&#8217;s support.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m very happy with the result for my first marathon, and looking
back, I don&#8217;t know if the pain and the subsequent slowdown in the last 4 miles
is (a) because we went out too fast, (b) because I didn&#8217;t do quite enough
training at a >20 mile distance, (c) lack of fuel, or (d) totally normal and
that&#8217;s why they call it a marathon.</p>

<p>I also have to praise the marathon organizers &#8211; this race had the best
organization (website, runner tracking, getting to the start line, knowing
what to expect), the best infrastructure (timing mats almost every mile,
drinks and food along the way), and the best cheering crowd of any race I&#8217;ve
ever been involved in. That&#8217;s what I was told to expect ahead of time, but it
sure lived up to expectations. If you&#8217;ve run NYC before you know what I&#8217;m
talking about, and if you haven&#8217;t and you&#8217;re a runner, do consider it. It
really was a great experience.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re curious for any more details, the marathon website has the detailed
splits available &#8211; go to <a href="http://trackmyrun%0Aners.ingnycmarathon.org/Runners.aspx">[http://trackmyrunners.ingnycmarathon.org/Runners.a
spx](http://trackmyrunners.ingnycmarathon.org/Runners.aspx)</a> and search for Ginzton. Then click the +
button on the far right, and it&#8217;ll turn my name into a link which you can
click on for the details.</p>
