<div class="entry-content"><p>Yeah I know, this is already well known and I&#8217;m just piling on and
complaining. Still, it&#8217;s annoying and worth noting. Airlines keep adding
arbitrary fees and reducing service quality. Boo. This is worse for us because
now we&#8217;re flying with Dominic as a lap infant and the airlines are especially
poorly optimized for this, at really every level. You can&#8217;t buy tickets the
easy way, you can&#8217;t check in the easy way, and everything gets harder.</p>

<p>A few recent experiences that sucked:</p>

<p>Southwest: they don&#8217;t charge for a lap infant and are generally friendly,
which is why we keep flying them. But if you have a lap infant, there&#8217;s no way
to add him to the reservation, but you do need to get a boarding pass, which
can only be done at the full-service checkin line, which is the longest and
slowest one. They&#8217;ve increasingly incented people to check in online and
either skip the front-of-airport counter if not checking luggage, or use the
faster &#8220;bag drop only&#8221; counter if checking luggage, and only people who never
travel and don&#8217;t realize any of this, or people with unticketed infants, end
up in the longest slowest understaffed full-service checkin line that the rest
of their policies are actively trying to drive us away from. Then, we need to
gate check Dominic&#8217;s car seat, which can only be done at the gate counter. So
every flight involves visiting both the front checkin counter and the gate
checkin counter. This doesn&#8217;t waste just our time, but also that of the
Southwest employees and everyone behind us in line, and really nobody
benefits.</p>

<p>Aer Lingus: on our trip to Ireland, we booked our international travel from
the US into Dublin and back from London, and left undecided how and when we&#8217;d
get from Ireland back to London. We eventually booked an Aer Lingus flight
from Waterford to London, which was easy enough (and even let us book a ticket
for Dominic with no hassle which was a pleasant surprise), but booking this
ticket on aerlingus.com also had an unpleasant surprise: they quoted the price
in euros right up till the final &#8220;buy&#8221; button, when they converted it to
dollars, at a rate about 8% worse than the going exchange rate. No way to opt
out of this. I&#8217;d have been happy if they charged me in dollars at the current
exchange rate, and I would have been fine if they&#8217;d charged me in euros and I
paid the credit card company their foreign transaction fee (around 3%), and I
would have been fine if they&#8217;d charged me in dollars at the current exchange
rate and added a 3% currency conversion surcharge. But silently pretending the
exchange rate was significantly worse than it is: that&#8217;s just shady.</p>

<p>United: trying to get to Mexico in December for a friend&#8217;s wedding, Kayak
quoted us $830 roundtrip for 2 adult tickets on United, and there&#8217;s no way to
add a lap infant through Kayak. I tried searching for the same flights on
United&#8217;s website, where we could add a lap infant, and it came to $915, the
extra $85 breaking down as $30 for the infant seat (fine) and another $55 in
US taxes (not fine, because they&#8217;re repeats of taxes already built into our
fare, and basically charging the same amount of tax for Dominic as for me and
Vanessa put together). I don&#8217;t know where the tax money is going or whose
fault this is, but it sure doesn&#8217;t seem right. So I called United to ask
whether I should add Dominic to the reservation up front and pay those taxes
or book without him and add him to the reservation after the fact, and they
couldn&#8217;t answer the tax question but said the website won&#8217;t let me book a lap
infant and I should definitely book without him then call back to add him.
Even though that didn&#8217;t seem true, I was hoping the taxes would resolve
themselves more sanely that way, so that&#8217;s what I did. Imagine my annoyance
when I call back to add Dominic to our reservation and am told they will
charge me $30 for his ticket, $55 in taxes which they can&#8217;t explain but they
are what they are, and $25 in reservation fees for not booking online, which
they now charge even for transactions which the website can&#8217;t do. (And while
the website seemed willing to book the lap infant as part of the reservation,
both customer service agents I talked to told me they don&#8217;t think it works,
and that even if it doesn&#8217;t work, that isn&#8217;t cause to waive the $25 fee.)
Fail.</p>

<p>On a less whiny and more humorous note, I&#8217;ll leave you with
<a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/2012/a-satire-about-the-hell-that-is-taking-a%0A-commercial-flight/">this</a>. C&#8217;mon, airlines, we just want to pay a fair price for a
fair service, no tricks or traps.</p>
