<div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past 12 years I&#8217;ve been a customer of Sprint, T-Mobile and
Cingular/AT&amp;T for wireless service in the US, and from this, I have a simple
view of what you get from each one. During that time I&#8217;ve lived in the San
Francisco Bay Area and traveled pretty extensively in cities on both coasts
and in the rural Pacific Northwest, so that&#8217;s what my coverage comments will
be based on.</p>

<p>(I&#8217;ve never been a Verizon customer, but it&#8217;s widely agreed that their service
is both good and expensive; it&#8217;s easy to verify their prices are on the high
end, and friends and family who use their service like the quality, so I&#8217;ll
repeat that viewpoint).</p>

<p>Summary: Sprint and T-Mobile are cheap; AT&amp;T and Verizon are expensive; Sprint
and Verizon have good coverage; AT&amp;T and T-Mobile have weak coverage; that
means Sprint is cheap and good, Verizon is expensive and good, T-Mobile is
cheap and weak, and AT&amp;T is expensive and weak.</p>

<p>Sprint, in 7 years of use, has always been the cheapest for the level of
service I get, and it&#8217;s always worked fine for me. Sure, there are rural areas
where they don&#8217;t have coverage, but in my experience their coverage is wider
than T-Mobile and equal to AT&amp;T, and anywhere they don&#8217;t have coverage, you
can roam for free on Verizon. Voice quality has been good; usually with even 1
bar of signal strength conversations work fine. Sprint often gets dismissed as
having bad customer service, but that hasn&#8217;t been my experience; also, in my
view, the best customer service is the one you have to deal with the least,
and I didn&#8217;t often have a need to call them.</p>

<p>T-Mobile was priced about the same as Sprint, but their coverage was notably
worse, both in the rural Pacific Northwest, and in urban San Francisco. I had
no real complaints in 2 years as a T-Mobile customer other than lack of signal
coverage in areas that mattered to me; that&#8217;s when I jumped ship to Cingular,
since I could bring along my existing GSM phone.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T worked OK (better than T-Mobile, no better than Sprint) with the older
phone I brought over from T-Mobile, until I got an iPhone in 2007. That
started 2 years of frustration, ultimately leading me to decide that the GSM
networks in the US haven&#8217;t kept up in terms of network quality, and bringing
me back to Sprint. In 2 years of iPhone use, I had daily experiences with
dropped calls, incoming calls that went straight to voicemail, and garbled
voice during calls that went through, all of this often with the phone
reporting 4 or 5 bars of signal strength. Voice calls weren&#8217;t the only
problem; often I&#8217;d take my phone out to look up a map or kill a few minutes
reading mail or the web, and be unable to do so, so I take issue with the
general assumption that the iPhone is a bad phone but great for everything
else and so great for modern people who don&#8217;t care about voice calls &#8211; those
people probably expect reliable wireless data, and aren&#8217;t getting it. One
observation I made during this time was that while every carrier&#8217;s coverage
has dead spots (they even have maps of this!), dead spots in space are pretty
easy to route around &#8211; you know where they are, and you can avoid them. But
AT&amp;T&#8217;s network is the only one I&#8217;ve seen where the signal quality varies
hugely in time as well, that is, where you could have perfect signal quality
at one time, and 5 minutes later in the same spot, no usable signal at all.
For me, signal quality that varies in time is far more frustrating than signal
quality that varies in space.</p>

<p>(There&#8217;s plenty of agreement on AT&amp;T&#8217;s dismal service quality, especially in
cities such as New York and San Francisco, and plenty of speculation on why &#8211;
maybe it&#8217;s the iPhone itself that&#8217;s buggy, maybe there are simply too many
users on the network &#8211; I just know that the 2 different iPhones I had were
not reliable for either voice or data use in the US, and they both worked a
lot better overseas on other networks once I unlocked them.)</p>

<p>So of the 3 networks I&#8217;ve tried, only Sprint was cheap and good; that for me
is a compelling combination and brought me back to them.</p>
